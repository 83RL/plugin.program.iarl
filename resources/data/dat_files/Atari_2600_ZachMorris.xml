It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F game console.The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, which stood for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982, the VCS was renamed to the "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge, initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.Developer:  AtariManufacturer:  AtariCPU:  MOS Technology 6507Memory:  128 bytes RAMGraphics:  128-color paletteSound:  Television Interface AdaptorMedia:  CartridgeMax.

Along the way, he must negotiate numerous hazards, including pits, quicksand, rolling logs, fire, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and crocodiles. Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on a vine to avoid them. Treasure includes gold and silver bars, diamond rings, and bags of money. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various places. This is required to get around some surface areas that have no way across otherwise. The tunnels are filled with dead-ends blocked by brick walls, forcing the player return to the surface at one of the ladders, and try to find a way around again. The tunnels also contain treasure and scorpions Harry must jump over.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>04/20/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/5317-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/5317-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5317-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19558-pitfall-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53302-pitfall-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5317-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19559-pitfall-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19560-pitfall-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53303-pitfall-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19561-pitfall-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/39696-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen-starting-the-game.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/39697-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-use-ropes-to-swing-over-bottomless.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/39698-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-ah-some-treasure.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/39699-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-swinging-over-some-alligators.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134595-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-score-has-reached-20-000-points.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134596-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-a-beautiful-diamond-ring-it.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134597-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-escaping-the-bite-of-a-dangerous.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134598-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-entering-the-catacomb-of-tunnels.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134599-pitfall-atari-2600-screenshot-death-by-a-scorpion-if-you-don.jpg</snapshot9>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/5317-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/5317.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Frogger">					<rom name="atari_2600_frogger_1982_parker_brothers_ed_english_david_lamkins_pb5300/atari_2600_frogger_1982_parker_brothers_ed_english_david_lamkins_pb5300.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Frogger</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_frogger_1982_parker_brothers_ed_english_david_lamkins_pb5300/atari_2600_frogger_1982_parker_brothers_ed_english_david_lamkins_pb5300_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Your task in this arcade conversion is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen.

The walkers are heavily armoured, and it will take a lot of fire power to destroy one! The game is played on a large, scrolling screen with a radar screen at the bottom to help keep track of where the enemy is located.

Your goal is to last as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>02/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8357-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/129284-enduro-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/265602-enduro-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/265603-enduro-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57174-enduro-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen-game-demo.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57175-enduro-atari-2600-screenshot-beginning-a-race.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57176-enduro-atari-2600-screenshot-be-careful-when-the-road-turns.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57177-enduro-atari-2600-screenshot-the-sun-begins-to-set.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57178-enduro-atari-2600-screenshot-driving-at-night.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57179-enduro-atari-2600-screenshot-driving-in-the-fog.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Star Wars - The Arcade Game">					<rom name="atari_2600_star_wars_-_the_arcade_game_04-05-1984_parker_brothers_wilfredo_willy_/atari_2600_star_wars_-_the_arcade_game_04-05-1984_parker_brothers_wilfredo_willy_.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Star Wars - The Arcade Game</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_star_wars_-_the_arcade_game_04-05-1984_parker_brothers_wilfredo_willy_/atari_2600_star_wars_-_the_arcade_game_04-05-1984_parker_brothers_wilfredo_willy__screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>In Jedi Arena, you have to face an opponent in the arena to see who is the true Jedi master. Wandering throughout the arena is a seeker which is capable of firing laser bolts. To be victorious you need to destroy your opponents shield by having the seeker fire laser bolts at it. You are armed only with a light saber which is used to control the direction of the laser bolts you fire, as well as block incoming fire from your opponent. The first player to break through the other players shield wins a point, and the first player to 3 points wins the match!

When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a &quot;knockout&quot;) or two minutes have elapsed (a &quot;decision&quot;). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the &quot;ropes&quot; and &quot;juggling&quot; him back and forth between alternate punches.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>07/01/1980</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7945-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7945-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57180-boxing-atari-2600-screenshot-setting-game-options.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57181-boxing-atari-2600-screenshot-a-fight-in-progress.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57182-boxing-atari-2600-screenshot-and-black-is-ahead-18-9.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57183-boxing-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white-mode.jpg</snapshot4>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7945.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Pitfall II - Lost Caverns">					<rom name="atari_2600_pitfall_ii_-_lost_caverns_1983_activision_david_crane_ab-035-04/atari_2600_pitfall_ii_-_lost_caverns_1983_activision_david_crane_ab-035-04.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Pitfall II - Lost Caverns</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_pitfall_ii_-_lost_caverns_1983_activision_david_crane_ab-035-04/atari_2600_pitfall_ii_-_lost_caverns_1983_activision_david_crane_ab-035-04_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You control Pitfall Harry as he makes his way through an underground Peruvian cave in search of the valuable Raj diamond, as well as his lost niece and cat.

Planet Earth still exists, but overpopulation has forced many of her former residents to colonize other worlds. After contact with an outer colony was lost, a battlegroup was sent to investigate and was almost completely destroyed; only one badly damaged ship returned to tell of a seemingly unstoppable alien warship that had effortlessly annihilated their forces.This was humankind's first encounter with a group of aliens they eventually came to know as the Covenant, a collective of alien races bent on wiping out humanity. A desperate plan is set in motion: board a Covenant vessel andlearn the location of the Covenant home world. But before the mission begins, Covenant forces strikeand annihilate the attack force.The Covenant are now on Earth's doorstep. One ship escapes and makes a blind jump into deep space, hoping to lead the Covenant away from Earth. The ship crashes on Halo--an artificial ring world that is actually a weapon capable of destroying all life in the galaxy should it fall into the hands of the Covenant.You are the Master Chief--all that remains of a classified military project to build a series of genetically enhanced super- soldiers. You are humanity's last and best hope against the Covenant--but you're woefully out-matched, and survival is not guaranteed. Can you battle your way through the massive world that is Halo, defeat the Covenant, and save humanity?Halo 2600 is an original homebrew game created by Ed Fries for the Atari 2600. Ed Fries once worked as the VP of Game Publishing for Microsoft's Xbox division and was instrumental in bringing Bungie Studios into the Microsoft studio family). AtariAge worked with Ed Fries to produce Halo 2600 in physical cartridge form, and a limited run was produced for the 2010 Classic Gaming Expo. After the Classic Gaming Expo, additional cartridges were produced using a different label to differentiate the two releases.In the game, Halo players control Master Chief in a non-scrolling exploration game with rooms to explore and a variety of enemies to shoot. The Chief faces a variety of enemies across 64 playfields, and must find hidden keys to unlock the game's force-fields in order to reach the final boss encounter.

Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1984</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56846-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56847-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/130389-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/48131-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen-game-demo.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/48132-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-dangerous-creatures.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/48133-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-screenshot-located-a-trapped-miner.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/48134-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-screenshot-blowing-up-a-wall-with-dynamite.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/48135-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-screenshot-trapped-behind-a-wall.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/48136-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-screenshot-blasting-through-a-wall-with.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/48137-h-e-r-o-atari-2600-screenshot-hovering-above-some-dangerous.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="California Games">					<rom name="atari_2600_california_games_1988_epyx_steven_a._baker_peter_engelbrite_80561-0028/atari_2600_california_games_1988_epyx_steven_a._baker_peter_engelbrite_80561-0028.bin" size="0"/>					<description>California Games</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_california_games_1988_epyx_steven_a._baker_peter_engelbrite_80561-0028/atari_2600_california_games_1988_epyx_steven_a._baker_peter_engelbrite_80561-0028_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Get ready for the gnarliest, most radically awesome sports events under the sun!

The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time. </plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51218-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51219-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51220-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92411-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-startup-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92412-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-which-path-should.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92413-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-you-get-a-closeup.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92414-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-different-enemies.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92415-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-if-i-chose-the.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92416-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-now-i-m-outnumbered.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92417-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-avoid-those-ninja.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92418-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-the-entrance.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92419-chuck-norris-superkicks-atari-2600-screenshot-two-minutes-left.jpg</snapshot9>			</game>			<game name="Commando">					<rom name="atari_2600_commando_1988_activision_mike_riedel_ak-043-04/atari_2600_commando_1988_activision_mike_riedel_ak-043-04.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Commando</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_commando_1988_activision_mike_riedel_ak-043-04/atari_2600_commando_1988_activision_mike_riedel_ak-043-04_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Super Joe is armed with a sub-machine gun (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades.

Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life.

Up to four players can compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon, either in sequence or individually. Included are the 100-meter dash, long jump, shot put, high jump, 400-meter race, 110-meter hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1500-meter race.The flat running events involve simple joystick waggling, which must be balanced with accurately-timed button presses to clear the hurdles - hitting them or breaking stride causes a loss of momentum and thus time. For jumping and throwing events, you must build momentum by waggling and then press the button to throw or jump at what you feel is the appropriate moment.For each event, points are earned based on how well you do (this can be based on your running time, or how far you throw the javelin or discus, etc...), and the player with the most points at the end of the decathlon wins the gold medal.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-4s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56844-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28289-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56845-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/135279-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/135282-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56791-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56792-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-the-different.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56793-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-the-shot-put.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56794-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-jumping-over.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56795-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-the-high-jump.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56796-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-throwing-the.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56797-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-pole-vaulting.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56798-the-activision-decathlon-atari-2600-screenshot-throwing-the.jpg</snapshot8>			</game>			<game name="X-man">					<rom name="atari_2600_x-man_1983_universal_gamex_corporation_alan_roberts_h.k._poon_gx-001/atari_2600_x-man_1983_universal_gamex_corporation_alan_roberts_h.k._poon_gx-001.bin" size="0"/>					<description>X-man</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_x-man_1983_universal_gamex_corporation_alan_roberts_h.k._poon_gx-001/atari_2600_x-man_1983_universal_gamex_corporation_alan_roberts_h.k._poon_gx-001_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>X-Man is an adult arcade game that has nothing to do with the similarly-named Marvel comics franchise. The player controls the titular X-Man, whose mind is focused on sex to the point of ignoring all danger. His objective is to make his way through a random maze, avoiding either crabs, scissors, or teeth, to get to the woman behind the door in the middle of the maze. The player has 90 seconds to get there.Once the intrepid hero reaches his &amp;quot;goal&amp;quot;, the player enters a so-called &amp;quot;Sexy Surprise&amp;quot; mode, which is a simple sex simulation mini-game that lasts until the woman reaches orgasm. Clearly contradictory to most comparable real-life situations, the player has only 30 seconds to satisfy her;  then it is off to the next maze.The player receives points equivalent to the amount of time remaining after X-man reaches the maze center. Points are also awarded for each increment of the sexual excitement meter. </plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196216-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-woman.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196217-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-x-man.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196218-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-crab.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196219-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-scissors.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196220-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-teeth.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196221-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-maze-1.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196222-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-i-made-it.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196223-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-now-to-reach-climax.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196224-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-score.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196225-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-maze-2.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Megamania - A Space Nightmare">					<rom name="atari_2600_megamania_-_a_space_nightmare_1982_activision_steve_cartwright_ax-017_/atari_2600_megamania_-_a_space_nightmare_1982_activision_steve_cartwright_ax-017_.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Megamania - A Space Nightmare</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_megamania_-_a_space_nightmare_1982_activision_steve_cartwright_ax-017_/atari_2600_megamania_-_a_space_nightmare_1982_activision_steve_cartwright_ax-017__screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>In Megamania, the gameplay resembles that of Space Invaders. Rather than being aliens or spaceships, however, the enemies in this game are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectiles attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe.Gameplay-wise and in terms of graphics, MegaMania bears a very strong resemblance to Sega's 1981 arcade title &quot;Astro Blaster&quot;. Both games feature nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an &quot;Energy&quot; meter. Also, the player's ship bears a remarkable similarity in both games.When Megamania was originally sold, anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen and become an official Megamaniac. They also would receive an Official Megamaniac emblem.[2]If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>09/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19862-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196216-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-woman.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196217-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-x-man.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196218-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-crab.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196219-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-scissors.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196220-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-intro-showing-the-teeth.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196221-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-maze-1.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196222-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-i-made-it.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196223-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-now-to-reach-climax.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196224-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-score.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196225-x-man-atari-2600-screenshot-maze-2.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Spider-man">					<rom name="atari_2600_spider-man_1982_parker_brothers_david_lamkins_laura_nikolich_pb5900/atari_2600_spider-man_1982_parker_brothers_david_lamkins_laura_nikolich_pb5900.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Spider-man</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_spider-man_1982_parker_brothers_david_lamkins_laura_nikolich_pb5900/atari_2600_spider-man_1982_parker_brothers_david_lamkins_laura_nikolich_pb5900_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The Green Goblin has set a super bomb at the top of a high voltage tower located on the top of a skyscaper! As Spider-Man, you need to scale the building and defuse the bomb. Use your web to climb the building, but be careful of Green Goblin's villians which appear in the windows trying to stop you. If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points. When you reach the top of the building, it's time to climb up the high voltage tower which is booby trapped with bombs. The bombs can be defused or avoided to get to the top, but just make sure you aren't too close to one that explodes! Once you arrive at the top of the tower, Green Goblin himself will be protecting the super bomb he has planted there. If you can sneak past Green Goblin and defuse the super bomb, the level is complete and you then move on to the next, more challenging level.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2957-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2957-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2957-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2957-4.jpg</fanart4>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2957-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23600-spider-man-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2957-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23601-spider-man-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23602-spider-man-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47166-spider-man-atari-2600-screenshot-climbing-the-building.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47167-spider-man-atari-2600-screenshot-swinging-back-and-forth.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47168-spider-man-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-bombs-on-the.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47169-spider-man-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-the-green-goblin.jpg</snapshot4>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2957-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2957.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Grand Prix">					<rom name="atari_2600_grand_prix_robby/atari_2600_grand_prix_robby.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Grand Prix</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_grand_prix_robby/atari_2600_grand_prix_robby_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Grand Prix is a Formula One Grand Prix motor racing-themed video game, and one of the first side-scrolling racing video games. It was designed and programmed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console, and published by Activision in 1982.Grand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes.

Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes.

Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit.

Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view </plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28696-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/200956-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28696-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52730-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52731-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/200955-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62042-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62043-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62044-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62045-star-trek-strategic-operations-simulator-atari-2600-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="River Raid Ii">					<rom name="atari_2600_river_raid_ii_1988_activision_david_lubar_ak-048-04/atari_2600_river_raid_ii_1988_activision_david_lubar_ak-048-04.bin" size="0"/>					<description>River Raid Ii</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_river_raid_ii_1988_activision_david_lubar_ak-048-04/atari_2600_river_raid_ii_1988_activision_david_lubar_ak-048-04_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>River Raid II continues the fast-paced shooting action of the 1982 original while adding new features such as varying altitude (the original only featured left and right movement), flying over oceans and firing torpedoes.

The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>07/15/1981</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5304-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20735-freeway-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56101-freeway-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5304-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20736-freeway-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20737-freeway-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56102-freeway-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56103-freeway-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/262817-freeway-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart9>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/42147-freeway-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/42148-freeway-atari-2600-screenshot-plenty-of-traffic-here.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/42149-freeway-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white-mode.jpg</snapshot3>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/5304-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="James Bond 007">					<rom name="atari_2600_james_bond_007_james_bond_agent_007_1983_parker_brothers_joe_gaucher_l/atari_2600_james_bond_007_james_bond_agent_007_1983_parker_brothers_joe_gaucher_l.bin" size="0"/>					<description>James Bond 007</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_james_bond_007_james_bond_agent_007_1983_parker_brothers_joe_gaucher_l/atari_2600_james_bond_007_james_bond_agent_007_1983_parker_brothers_joe_gaucher_l_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>In James Bond 007 you control James Bond in his multi purpose craft. This craft can travel on both land and sea, can jump over danger, or fire at enemies on the many different levels. Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56146-james-bond-007-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56147-james-bond-007-atari-2600-screenshot-jump-over-those-large.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56148-james-bond-007-atari-2600-screenshot-shoot-the-diamonds-for.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56149-james-bond-007-atari-2600-screenshot-travelling-by-sea.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Gauntlet">					<rom name="atari_2600_gauntlet_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1002/atari_2600_gauntlet_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1002.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Gauntlet</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_gauntlet_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1002/atari_2600_gauntlet_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1002_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>This game has nothing to do with the Atari arcade game or any of the home-ported versions.You are the great explorer, Sir Robert Wittenbottom.

The hero has no offensive abilities and must jump or otherwise avoid enemy attacks.

An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:THE SEAGULL:  Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.THE SLIP:  Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him &quot;the slip&quot;.  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.SCORING:  Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22152-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/33340-dolphin-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/33341-dolphin-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53810-dolphin-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53811-dolphin-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56562-dolphin-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-demo-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56563-dolphin-atari-2600-screenshot-running-from-the-squid.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56564-dolphin-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-the-column-of-sea.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/56565-dolphin-atari-2600-screenshot-the-squid-is-closing-in.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Bachelor Party">					<rom name="atari_2600_bachelor_party/atari_2600_bachelor_party.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Bachelor Party</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_bachelor_party/atari_2600_bachelor_party_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>This was a double-ended cartridge that contained Bachelor Party on one end and a new game, Gigolo, on the other.In Gigolo, men will leave the jail and head to various houses.

Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time!

The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down.

As a Smurf, the player has to walk from the Smurf village through a forest and a cave on the way to Gargamel's castle, where Smurfette awaits rescue. The player has an energy bar that slowly depletes over time.Each side-scrolling screen presents various obstacles that the player must precisely jump over (e.g. fences, stalagmites) or land upon (e.g. ledges). Failure to execute any jump results in instant death. Higher difficulty levels introduce flying bats and spiders that the player must also avoid.The ColecoVision version of Smurf: Rescue in Gargamel's Castle contains an Easter egg. Upon reaching Smurfette's screen, the player can return to the previous screen.

There are two main stages in the game, each of which you must pass to move to the next round.  The first mission involves rescuing injured soldiers from the battlefield with your helicopter and returning them to home base without being shot down by enemy tanks.  The second mission takes place in the operating room while you are required to carefully remove bullets and shrapnel from wounded soldiers... it is very similar to the classic &amp;quot;OPERATION&amp;quot; tweezers game by Milton Bradley.Each set of missions are repeated four times.  The first player to reach 999 points wins the game. There are four different variations of games, each selectable as either one player (against the computer) or two-player mode.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258958-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258959-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53011-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134546-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen-select-game-options.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134547-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-the-first-screen-rescuing-men.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134548-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-in-the-operating-room.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134549-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-can-you-get-this-piece-of-shrapnel.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134550-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-variation-with-smaller.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134551-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-catch-the-skydivers-before-they.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134552-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-my-chopper-was-shot-down.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134553-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-the-rescue-screen-in-black-and.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134554-m-a-s-h-atari-2600-screenshot-the-operating-room-in-black.jpg</snapshot9>			</game>			<game name="Atari VCS Point-of-Purchase">					<rom name="atari_2600_atari_vcs_point-of-purchase_rom/atari_2600_atari_vcs_point-of-purchase_rom.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Atari VCS Point-of-Purchase</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_atari_vcs_point-of-purchase_rom/atari_2600_atari_vcs_point-of-purchase_rom_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The Games that Defined a Generation!Product InformationFlash back to the 80's!

Additionally, numerous fireballs will be flying around the screen trying to stop the Wind Raider, with Skeletor running along on the ground. The Wind Raider is equipped with bombs and guns which can be used to defend He-Man from the fireballs, while also earning bonus points if Skeletor is hit.

After a set period of time, a klaxon will warn of renewed meteor activity, and the player must return immediately to defend the ark.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21347-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19981-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/32049-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53307-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19982-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19983-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/32050-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/32051-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53308-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53309-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/40490-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/40491-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-screenshot-defend-the-ark-from-asteroids.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/40492-cosmic-ark-atari-2600-screenshot-save-creatures-from-the-planets.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Beamrider">					<rom name="atari_2600_beamrider/atari_2600_beamrider.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Beamrider</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_beamrider/atari_2600_beamrider_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>A web of iridescent blue beams engulfs Earth-Space.

One word of caution: this game takes a little time to learn because it's so challenging. It's very tricky. So, please read these directions and give yourself some practice time. Then you can aim for the World Record.Game 1: Straight-ahead Dragster, one or two players.Game 2: Steerable Dragster, one or two players.Your Joystick Controller is both the clutch and gear shift for your Dragster; the red button is your gas pedal. Use left Joystick for the top car; right one for bottom car. Hold Joystick with button at the upper left.To shift gears, clutch by pushing Joystick to the left and shift by letting the Joystick spring back to the center.Your car starts each race in neutral (N). There are four gear positions--1, 2, 3, 4--and you must clutch and shift between each gear. You cannot downshift.When the countdown reaches 0, you can start. If you drop into gear too soon, before the end of the countdown, EARLY will appear on the screen and you have to wait for the next race. You can clutch during the countdown, but you cannot drop into 1st until  the countdown reaches 0.The object of Dragster is to beat your opponent across the screen, or to race against the clock for best time.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1980</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22154-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/25466-dragster-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/199635-dragster-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/25467-dragster-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/25468-dragster-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/199636-dragster-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/199637-dragster-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50811-dragster-atari-2600-screenshot-a-race-in-progress.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50812-dragster-atari-2600-screenshot-and-the-top-car-pulls-ahead.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50813-dragster-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Winter Games">					<rom name="atari_2600_winter_games_1987_epyx_steven_a._baker_tod_frye_peter_engelbrite_80561/atari_2600_winter_games_1987_epyx_steven_a._baker_tod_frye_peter_engelbrite_80561.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Winter Games</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_winter_games_1987_epyx_steven_a._baker_tod_frye_peter_engelbrite_80561/atari_2600_winter_games_1987_epyx_steven_a._baker_tod_frye_peter_engelbrite_80561_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>WINTER GAMES is a series of seven exciting competitive events.

Though most of the gameplay focuses around dogfighting with enemy bogeys (dodging missiles). In addition to that, there are also night-flying missions that add difficulty due to limited vision.Taking off and landing however, also requires additional skill as your doing it on the USS Enterprise (No relation to Star Trek), not on your standard airstrip. Pay attention to the F.D. officer as your preparing to take off (since he's the boss when it comes to this stuff...and try not to run over him...yet).Your weaponry consists of a M 61 Machine Gun and 3 different AIM Missiles (AIM 7, 9, 54) each packed with 15 missiles (that's a lot of missiles!).After each mission you will receive a Mission Rating which is based on your flying skill, number of bogey kill and number of weapons fired.</plot>					<genre>Flight Simulator</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1988</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28702-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56869-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28702-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56870-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213889-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71206-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71207-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71208-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71209-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71210-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Frogs And Flies - Frogs 'n' Flies">					<rom name="atari_2600_frogs_and_flies_-_frogs_n_flies_1982_m_network_david_rolfe_-_intv_mt56/atari_2600_frogs_and_flies_-_frogs_n_flies_1982_m_network_david_rolfe_-_intv_mt56.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Frogs And Flies - Frogs 'n' Flies</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_frogs_and_flies_-_frogs_n_flies_1982_m_network_david_rolfe_-_intv_mt56/atari_2600_frogs_and_flies_-_frogs_n_flies_1982_m_network_david_rolfe_-_intv_mt56_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Frogs and Flies is a 1982 video game by Mattel for the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 platforms. In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.Each game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen  the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a &quot;The End&quot; message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.There are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water  in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.A version of this game was also released for Mattel's IntelliVision system, titled Frog Bog; though it was graphically superior to Frogs and Flies, its controls were less fluent.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18549-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56869-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56870-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213889-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71206-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71207-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71208-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71209-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71210-dan-kitchen-s-tomcat-the-f-14-fighter-simulator-atari-2600.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Cruise Missile">					<rom name="atari_2600_cruise_missile_aka_exocet_1987_froggo_fg1007/atari_2600_cruise_missile_aka_exocet_1987_froggo_fg1007.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Cruise Missile</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_cruise_missile_aka_exocet_1987_froggo_fg1007/atari_2600_cruise_missile_aka_exocet_1987_froggo_fg1007_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Suicide Mission is an arcade action game similar to Asteroids.

Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5323-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22507-robot-tank-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5323-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22508-robot-tank-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22509-robot-tank-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22510-robot-tank-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45483-robot-tank-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45490-robot-tank-atari-2600-screenshot-an-enemy-tank-has-been-destroyed.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45485-robot-tank-atari-2600-screenshot-it-can-be-difficult-to-spot.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45486-robot-tank-atari-2600-screenshot-a-complete-squadron-has-been.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45487-robot-tank-atari-2600-screenshot-the-rain-may-impede-your-progress.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45488-robot-tank-atari-2600-screenshot-can-you-track-a-tank-in-the.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45489-robot-tank-atari-2600-screenshot-firing-on-an-enemy-tank.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="Gyruss">					<rom name="atari_2600_gyruss_1984_parker_brothers_pb5080/atari_2600_gyruss_1984_parker_brothers_pb5080.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Gyruss</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_gyruss_1984_parker_brothers_pb5080/atari_2600_gyruss_1984_parker_brothers_pb5080_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The entire solar system is being attacked by the vicious Gyrusians, and it's up to you to save the day! You will need to fly your spaceship to each of the nine planets and then clear three stages of enemies to rid that planet of the Gyrusians. You start the game with a single cannon, but can gain a double cannon after shooting a power up satellite. After clearing each planet, there is another bonus stage where additional weapons and bonus points can be collected. Gyruss is an arcade action shooter, however instead of piloting your spaceship horizontally or vertically, you move in a circle around the perimeter of the screen. The NES version of Gyruss adds to the original arcade version additional music, additional weapons, new enemies, and a large boss at the end of each level.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1984</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28595-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28595-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/21443-gyruss-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/43890-gyruss-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/43891-gyruss-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/43892-gyruss-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-the-satellites.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/43893-gyruss-atari-2600-screenshot-arrived-at-neptune.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Androman On The Moon">					<rom name="atari_2600_androman_on_the_moon_prototype/atari_2600_androman_on_the_moon_prototype.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Androman On The Moon</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_androman_on_the_moon_prototype/atari_2600_androman_on_the_moon_prototype_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The moon is under attack from a horde of aliens, and you must stop them in your armed buggy.

The player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an invisible force field that prevents the player's saucer from getting too close to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.Players who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1981</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19892-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20131-laser-blast-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20132-laser-blast-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20133-laser-blast-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/40970-laser-blast-atari-2600-screenshot-firing-laser-blasts.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/40971-laser-blast-atari-2600-screenshot-avoid-enemy-fire.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/40972-laser-blast-atari-2600-screenshot-try-to-crash-land-on-an-enemy.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/40973-laser-blast-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Tank City">					<rom name="atari_2600_tank_city_aka_thunderground_funvision_-_fund._international_co./atari_2600_tank_city_aka_thunderground_funvision_-_fund._international_co..bin" size="0"/>					<description>Tank City</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_tank_city_aka_thunderground_funvision_-_fund._international_co./atari_2600_tank_city_aka_thunderground_funvision_-_fund._international_co._screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything in their path!

Each mode includes five different skill levels which affect the length of the course (and the number of gates in slalom mode.)</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1980</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7954-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51919-carnival-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79042-carnival-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51920-carnival-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51921-carnival-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79041-carnival-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46063-carnival-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46064-carnival-atari-2600-screenshot-shooting-targets.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46065-carnival-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-the-bullet-eating.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46066-carnival-atari-2600-screenshot-almost-all-of-the-targets-are.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Solar Fox">					<rom name="atari_2600_solar_fox_1983_cbs_electronics_bob_curtiss_4l_2487_5000/atari_2600_solar_fox_1983_cbs_electronics_bob_curtiss_4l_2487_5000.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Solar Fox</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_solar_fox_1983_cbs_electronics_bob_curtiss_4l_2487_5000/atari_2600_solar_fox_1983_cbs_electronics_bob_curtiss_4l_2487_5000_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>On a daring mission to save an energy-starved Earth, you must navigate your Starship through a complex matrix of precious solar-cells.

When all of the cells in a matrix have been collected, you move on to the next round. Each matrix is guarded by two sentinels trying to stop you. The sentinels wander around the perimeter of the matrix, and will shoot fireballs at your spaceship which can destroy it. You are unarmed, so your only defense against the fireballs is to avoid them. To help you out a bit, your ship is capable of flying at two different speeds. Each round begins with a 'skip-a-rack' timer; if you collect all solar cells before this timer runs out, you will earn bonus points and skip ahead a level. The game ends when you have lost all of your space ships.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23771-solar-fox-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23772-solar-fox-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23773-solar-fox-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47303-solar-fox-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47304-solar-fox-atari-2600-screenshot-collecting-solar-cells.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47305-solar-fox-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-incoming-fireballs.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47306-solar-fox-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Cat Trax">					<rom name="atari_2600_cat_trax_1983_ua_limited_prototype/atari_2600_cat_trax_1983_ua_limited_prototype.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Cat Trax</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_cat_trax_1983_ua_limited_prototype/atari_2600_cat_trax_1983_ua_limited_prototype_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>This is the among the oldest of battles: cat vs. dog.You are the cat.

Periodically, a green potion will appear. If the cat gets the green potion, it will transform into a dog catcher's truck and can capture the dogs. Any dog captured is sent to the pound at the top of the screen where they remain until the potion wears off, at which time they then start chasing you again. A bag of catnip will appear in the maze.

In addition to the basic racing version, several other game variations are included as well.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1977</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7956-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/247093-motocross-racer-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93172-motocross-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-startup-screen-xonox.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93173-motocross-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-beginning-the-desert.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93174-motocross-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-the-horizon-approaches.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93175-motocross-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-the-uphill-race.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93176-motocross-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-the-side-scrolling-beach.jpg</snapshot5>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7956.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Berenstain Bears">					<rom name="atari_2600_berenstain_bears/atari_2600_berenstain_bears.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Berenstain Bears</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_berenstain_bears/atari_2600_berenstain_bears_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>In this children's learning game, you play as the Berenstain bear called Brother.

In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and destroy your starbases. In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>12/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1357-2.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/126009-starmaster-atari-2600-screenshot-game-4-starmaster-selected.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/126010-starmaster-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/126012-starmaster-atari-2600-screenshot-warping-to-a-sector-with.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/126014-starmaster-atari-2600-screenshot-starmap.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/126015-starmaster-atari-2600-screenshot-fighting-and-taking-damage.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/126016-starmaster-atari-2600-screenshot-my-final-score.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Pac Kong">					<rom name="atari_2600_pac_kong_aka_spider_kong_unknown/atari_2600_pac_kong_aka_spider_kong_unknown.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Pac Kong</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_pac_kong_aka_spider_kong_unknown/atari_2600_pac_kong_aka_spider_kong_unknown_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Pac-Kong plays very similar to Donkey Kong. The player controls an &quot;adventurer&quot; (called Kong in some versions of the game) and has to reach the treasures the evil octopus hid away.Each level consists of a series of platforms that are interconnected by ladders. The only action the player can take besides moving around is pressing fire to make the hero jump. This is necessary to get across the gaps between some of the platforms. At the same time, the player has to avoid the smaller octopi as well as clouds of poison gas which move around the screen randomly.

You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1363-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1363-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/41213-moonsweeper-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78078-moonsweeper-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen-game-demo.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78079-moonsweeper-atari-2600-screenshot-flying-in-space.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78080-moonsweeper-atari-2600-screenshot-rescue-miners-on-the-moon.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78081-moonsweeper-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-lunar-towers.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78082-moonsweeper-atari-2600-screenshot-aliens-attacking.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78083-moonsweeper-atari-2600-screenshot-flying-along-a-moon-s-surface.jpg</snapshot6>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1363.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bumper Bash">					<rom name="atari_2600_bumper_bash_paddle_1983_spectravideo_david_lubar_sa-218/atari_2600_bumper_bash_paddle_1983_spectravideo_david_lubar_sa-218.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Bumper Bash</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_bumper_bash_paddle_1983_spectravideo_david_lubar_sa-218/atari_2600_bumper_bash_paddle_1983_spectravideo_david_lubar_sa-218_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>This is a pinball game for the Atari 2600.

The game controls are identical. The alterations are that the graphics and colors were changed. Also, the options were reduced to one or two player and whether, in one player, the human player is up first at bat or not.Otherwise, everything else is the same. You still can throw fastballs, curve balls, sinkers, etc. and you can still bunt, hit fly balls, etc. Scoring remains the same with a tie after nine innings going into extra innings.

You play a thief who is trapped in a maze like vault. To get out, you need to collect all of the gold dots located in the maze. Your task won't be easy, since there are four police officers in the vault who are constantly trying to catch you! Located throughout the maze are numerous doors. As you run through the maze, you have the ability to temporarily close a door in an attempt to block the police. You can only close two doors at a time, and any closed doors automatically open again after a short amount of time. When all of the gold in the maze has been collected, the exit to the vault will open and you can escape and move on to the next, more difficult vault. Occasionally a bonus item will appear in the maze, such as a cash bag, crown, or briefcase, which can be collected to earn even more points.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36712-lock-n-chase-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36713-lock-n-chase-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51787-lock-n-chase-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46015-lock-n-chase-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46016-lock-n-chase-atari-2600-screenshot-you-ve-been-caught.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Red Vs.

After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22216-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/32434-fire-fly-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/32435-fire-fly-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/32436-fire-fly-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70740-fire-fly-atari-2600-screenshot-fighting-a-flaming-pumpkin.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70741-fire-fly-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-these-demons.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70742-fire-fly-atari-2600-screenshot-some-coiled-jumping-snakes-attack.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70743-fire-fly-atari-2600-screenshot-incoming-enemies.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Shuttle Orbiter">					<rom name="atari_2600_shuttle_orbiter_1983_avalon_hill_jean_baer_bill_hood_5004002/atari_2600_shuttle_orbiter_1983_avalon_hill_jean_baer_bill_hood_5004002.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Shuttle Orbiter</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_shuttle_orbiter_1983_avalon_hill_jean_baer_bill_hood_5004002/atari_2600_shuttle_orbiter_1983_avalon_hill_jean_baer_bill_hood_5004002_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of space shuttle Discovery.

When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used.</plot>					<genre>Action, Simulation</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5326-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5326-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183136-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183137-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-lift-off.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183138-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-orbiting-the-earth-not.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183139-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-docked-with-the-fuel.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183140-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-stopping-at-the-orbiting.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183141-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-flying-through-space.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183142-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-we-are-at-the-space.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183143-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-the-astronaught-is-outside.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183144-shuttle-orbiter-atari-2600-screenshot-i-ran-out-of-fuel-so.jpg</snapshot9>			</game>			<game name="Ghost Manor">					<rom name="atari_2600_ghost_manor_1983_xonox_-_k-tel_software_-_beck-tech_6210_06002_06004_9/atari_2600_ghost_manor_1983_xonox_-_k-tel_software_-_beck-tech_6210_06002_06004_9.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Ghost Manor</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_ghost_manor_1983_xonox_-_k-tel_software_-_beck-tech_6210_06002_06004_9/atari_2600_ghost_manor_1983_xonox_-_k-tel_software_-_beck-tech_6210_06002_06004_9_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>As one of the Xonox &quot;Double Ender&quot; cartridges, this features Ghost Manor and Spike's Peak.

Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel.

Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.IT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)You use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.As you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).After you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.You start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.Game variationsAfter you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.The difficulty settings are:Easy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.Normal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.Hard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.The difficulty switches are not used.After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.ScoringReadiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.Damage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.Destroy the left or right generator=2000 pointsDestroy the center generator=5000 pointsShield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.</plot>					<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258777-death-trap-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258778-death-trap-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258779-death-trap-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/182797-death-trap-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/182798-death-trap-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-a-game-on-easy-level.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/182799-death-trap-atari-2600-screenshot-trying-to-destroy-the-right.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/182800-death-trap-atari-2600-screenshot-going-after-the-left-generator.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/182801-death-trap-atari-2600-screenshot-if-i-can-destroy-this-middle.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/182802-death-trap-atari-2600-screenshot-got-him.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/182803-death-trap-atari-2600-screenshot-i-won-and-got-a-medal.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="Fire Fighter">					<rom name="atari_2600_fire_fighter_fire_fighters_1982_imagic_brad_stewart_720105-1a_ia3400/atari_2600_fire_fighter_fire_fighters_1982_imagic_brad_stewart_720105-1a_ia3400.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Fire Fighter</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_fire_fighter_fire_fighters_1982_imagic_brad_stewart_720105-1a_ia3400/atari_2600_fire_fighter_fire_fighters_1982_imagic_brad_stewart_720105-1a_ia3400_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Fire!

Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.)

Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

Several difficulty levels are included, which control the speed and intelligence of the gopher, and whether or not the duck will appear.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28690-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28690-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54479-gopher-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70866-gopher-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70867-gopher-atari-2600-screenshot-the-gopher-is-tunneling-his-way.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70868-gopher-atari-2600-screenshot-the-duck-flies-by-and-drops-carrot.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70869-gopher-atari-2600-screenshot-uh-oh-the-gopher-made-it-to-the.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Sea Hunt">					<rom name="atari_2600_sea_hunt_aka_skindiver_1987/atari_2600_sea_hunt_aka_skindiver_1987.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Sea Hunt</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_sea_hunt_aka_skindiver_1987/atari_2600_sea_hunt_aka_skindiver_1987_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Originating in the arcades, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1984</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28710-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28710-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/21819-spy-hunter-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44577-spy-hunter-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44574-spy-hunter-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44575-spy-hunter-atari-2600-screenshot-the-weapons-van-is-on-the.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/44576-spy-hunter-atari-2600-screenshot-driving-the-boat.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="I Want My Mommy">					<rom name="atari_2600_i_want_my_mommy_aka_open_sesame_kidstuff_1983_zimag_-_emag_-_vidco_710/atari_2600_i_want_my_mommy_aka_open_sesame_kidstuff_1983_zimag_-_emag_-_vidco_710.bin" size="0"/>					<description>I Want My Mommy</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_i_want_my_mommy_aka_open_sesame_kidstuff_1983_zimag_-_emag_-_vidco_710/atari_2600_i_want_my_mommy_aka_open_sesame_kidstuff_1983_zimag_-_emag_-_vidco_710_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Poor Teddy.

Bam! Watch out, ma'am!You are Demolition Herby and you're out to own the roads. You must drive around a square section to black it out; the object being to black out all sections. There are only three things in your way: the chase cars. When they drive over a line you have turned red, it turns white again. To make matters worse, they will try to ram you off the track. The good news is if you ram them from behind, you run them off the track for a few seconds. If you need a burst of speed, shift into overdrive by pressing your button however, there is a drawback, as I will explain. Something else to keep an eye on is your fuel.

The game is played from an overhead view of the course, which is complete with sand traps, water hazards, trees, and rough. The player doesn't have the ability to choose different clubs, so the distance the ball travels is controlled by how big of a backswing is taken. The direction is controlled by the location of the player in relation to the ball. When the player finally reaches the green, the view switches to a closeup of the green for putting. Two different skill levels are available which control the size of the cup and the amount of power lost in the rough or sand.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1980</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22946-golf-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36717-golf-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22947-golf-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22948-golf-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22949-golf-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36718-golf-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46222-golf-atari-2600-screenshot-teeing-off-on-the-first-hole.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46223-golf-atari-2600-screenshot-putting.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46224-golf-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-trees-and-sand.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46225-golf-atari-2600-screenshot-teeing-off-on-the-third-hole.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46226-golf-atari-2600-screenshot-be-careful-of-the-water-hazard.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/46232-golf-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white-mode.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Armor Ambush">					<rom name="atari_2600_armor_ambush/atari_2600_armor_ambush.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Armor Ambush</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_armor_ambush/atari_2600_armor_ambush_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Each player has two tanks per battle.

In addition to the basic racing version, several other game variations are included as well.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1977</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-4s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7956-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30357-street-racer-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/201047-street-racer-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30358-street-racer-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/30359-street-racer-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/135236-street-racer-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/201048-street-racer-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/201049-street-racer-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62389-street-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-racecar-racing.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62390-street-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-the-slalom.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62391-street-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-avoid-the-obstacles.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62392-street-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-the-jet-shooter-variation.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62393-street-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-number-cruncher.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62394-street-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-of-scoop-ball.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62395-street-racer-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white.jpg</snapshot7>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7956.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Tax Avoiders">					<rom name="atari_2600_tax_avoiders_1982_american_videogame_-_dunhill_electronics_darrell_wag/atari_2600_tax_avoiders_1982_american_videogame_-_dunhill_electronics_darrell_wag.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Tax Avoiders</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_tax_avoiders_1982_american_videogame_-_dunhill_electronics_darrell_wag/atari_2600_tax_avoiders_1982_american_videogame_-_dunhill_electronics_darrell_wag_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You are John Q and you want to be rich.In this game, you start out on the income screen where you try to collect the money (dollar signs) while avoiding the governmental red tape (look like red snakes).

My, how time flies.Once a season, you are sent to the investment/tax shelter screen, where you must collect an icon representing an investment and then grab your portfolio (briefcase). Investments have a 50/50 chance of making or losing money. Also on this screen is a character whose color changes.What color he is determines who he is:Black=Eggie, the IRS agent. If he catches you, he will audit you. In these audits, you always lose. You are then taxed at 50% of your income and sent back to the income screen.There are no appeals to tax court.Pink=Waggie, the CPA. If he catches you (or you go to him), he will charge you $1,000.00 but whatever tax sheltered investment you have, he will put you in a better one.Green=Toodles, the registered investment adviser. If you two meet, he will put you in the best tax sheltered investment available, thus making you the most profit.After each season, you are taxed to an amount determined by your tax shelter.

Most bombs exploded on impact, yet some would sit inactive for hours, days, or weeks before detonating. It was up to the Royal Engineers to find and defuse these bombs (UXB's) before they exploded. As a lance corporal in the Royal Engineers, it is the player's job to defuse these bombs.First, the player will need to check the London map to see where the bombs are then start defusing them: On the C64, the player may use the joystick to cause the dial to rotate, changing the numbers next to a switch then clicking on the disarm switch at the bottom. If the number is wrong, the player may change it again and keep trying. On the Atari 2600, the player may slide a sliding bar. On green bombs, the top bar controls the left switch, the middle controls the middle switch, and the bottom controls the right switch. The player may set the slide to a spot the move to the switches and push right. On orange bombs, which slide bar controls what switch varies from bomb to bomb; on blue bombs, the player cannot control the switches. They just randomly change and the player pushes right and hoping to disarm it in time.At the start of the game, the player may select which rank to start at, from lance corporal to second lieutenant on the C64 or from lance corporal to first lieutenant on the Atari 2600. Every time the player disarms a bomb, the player move up levels within a rank. Move up eight levels and gain a promotion. If a bomb explodes in the city and causes damage, the player is demoted a level in the rank. The possible ranks are (from lowest to highest): lance corporal, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant, warrant officer, lieutenant, first lieutenant, and captain.The player loses the game if demoted below lance corporal or a bomb explodes while the player is near it, a not-very-healthy thing to happen. The player wins if promoted to captain, whereupon you will be given a desk job.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184561-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-screen-and-level.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184562-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-the-map.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184563-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-walking-the-streets-of.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184565-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-this-is-a-green-bomb-these.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184566-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-i-ve-gotten-two-slides.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184567-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-at-a-crossroads.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184568-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-this-is-an-orange-bomb.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184569-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-this-is-ablue-bomb-you.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184570-london-blitz-atari-2600-screenshot-i-died-and-this-is-my-final.jpg</snapshot9>			</game>			<game name="Crash Dive">					<rom name="atari_2600_crash_dive_voyage_to_the_bottom_of_the_sea_1983_20th_century_fox_video/atari_2600_crash_dive_voyage_to_the_bottom_of_the_sea_1983_20th_century_fox_video.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Crash Dive</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_crash_dive_voyage_to_the_bottom_of_the_sea_1983_20th_century_fox_video/atari_2600_crash_dive_voyage_to_the_bottom_of_the_sea_1983_20th_century_fox_video_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The object of this game is to use your flying sub, the Sea Hunter,  to destroy enemies and get treasures.You move fastest when in the air, half speed when in the water and cannot move forward when on the sea bottom.Your enemies and their point values are:Plane = 300Helicopter = 100Bird = 0Boat = 50Sting Ray = 20Shark = 100Angler Fish = 200Squid = 100Lobster = 25You get 1 point for stunning the sea monster but cannot kill him.

Each of the two games was released separately, though it's generally more common to find them in this form. This particular double-ender is the most common to feature either of these games.The Double-Ender is two games in one - each end of the cartridge has a different game. These cartridges are about 2.5 inches longer than a standard cartridge, and the case is wider in the middle. There is one long label that is typically blue, with game art for both sides split diagonally down the middle. Titles are printed in red text against a yellow banner. All the titles found on the Double-Enders can also be found in standard single-ended cases.Xonox, based in Minnesota, started developing Atari cartridges during the height of the 2600's popularity. They contributed many high quality games available for the early platforms. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of &quot;double-ender&quot; cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles.

You are Jane Marvin. Your finance and five of your friends are turning into alligators due to a failed medical experiment. You must get the alligator antidote to cure them.You, as a syringe, must move about the screen, gathering antidotes and serums. Serums supposedly increase the strength of the antidote so you need less to cure someone. You must then aim at the infected person at the top or bottom of the screen and press your button to inject them. The longer you take to get the antidote to them, the more they will mutate and the more antidote it will require to cure them. Everything is not so simple, however, as there are normal alligators in the swamp and you will lose you a life if they touch you. You can shoot to kill them and it will not cost you an antidote.Some variations have walls that move. These make it harder to see the alligators, antidotes and serums. Serums only appear in variations with walls. Some variations allow you to pass through the walls, others will make the walls solid and they can crush you if you get between two closing ones. Once you cure all six friends, it is off to the next level.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/2003</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/252965-alligator-people-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-level-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/252966-alligator-people-atari-2600-screenshot-i-cured-all-my-friends.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/252968-alligator-people-atari-2600-screenshot-close-call-with-an.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/252969-alligator-people-atari-2600-screenshot-crunch.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Tunnel Runner">					<rom name="atari_2600_tunnel_runner_black_box_1983_cbs_electronics_richard_k._balaska_jr._an/atari_2600_tunnel_runner_black_box_1983_cbs_electronics_richard_k._balaska_jr._an.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Tunnel Runner</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_tunnel_runner_black_box_1983_cbs_electronics_richard_k._balaska_jr._an/atari_2600_tunnel_runner_black_box_1983_cbs_electronics_richard_k._balaska_jr._an_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Get a move on, TUNNEL RUNNER.

Each of the two games was released separately, though it's generally more common to find them in this form. This particular double-ender is the most common to feature either of these games.The Double-Ender is two games in one - each end of the cartridge has a different game. These cartridges are about 2.5 inches longer than a standard cartridge, and the case is wider in the middle. There is one long label that is typically blue, with game art for both sides split diagonally down the middle. Titles are printed in red text against a yellow banner. All the titles found on the Double-Enders can also be found in standard single-ended cases.Xonox, based in Minnesota, started developing Atari cartridges during the height of the 2600's popularity. They contributed many high quality games available for the early platforms. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of &quot;double-ender&quot; cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles. Xonox eventually abandoned this idea and began releasing single versions of some of the titles previously offered as double-enders as well as a few new titles.Xonox was one of many small video game companies to fold during the Video Game Crash of 1983.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19844-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94680-robin-hood-atari-2600-screenshot-xonox-logo-and-game-demo.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94681-robin-hood-atari-2600-screenshot-fighting-henchman-in-the-forest.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94682-robin-hood-atari-2600-screenshot-you-need-to-fight-off-the.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94683-robin-hood-atari-2600-screenshot-can-you-find-maid-marian-somewhere.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Harbor Escape">					<rom name="atari_2600_harbor_escape_aka_river_raid_1983_panda_110/atari_2600_harbor_escape_aka_river_raid_1983_panda_110.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Harbor Escape</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_harbor_escape_aka_river_raid_1983_panda_110/atari_2600_harbor_escape_aka_river_raid_1983_panda_110_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Jason has taken the Golden Fleece from the gods!

If you collect the power dot (pulsar), you can kill any of the three aliens, for a short time. There are only three enemies in the maze at a time, there is a bonus item at times and only one power dot (pulsar) at a time. When you grab the pulsar, it will next appear in one of two other spots.After you clear one level, you get a bonus game. You have to move up the screen to the prize at the top past several aliens, reminiscent of Freeway.

When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes.

Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields. </plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106017-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-imagic-logo.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106018-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-these-force-fields-will.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106019-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-that-rocket.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106020-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-blast-your-way-through-this.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106021-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-strange-flying-creatures.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106022-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-be-careful-your-shield-is.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Asterix">					<rom name="atari_2600_asterix/atari_2600_asterix.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Asterix</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_asterix/atari_2600_asterix_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The game was essentially a European adaptation of the Taz platform game, made by replacing the Taz sprite with a sprite which vaguely resembles Asterix's head.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9243-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19819-asteroids-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34131-asteroids-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/101426-asteroids-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/204045-asteroids-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19820-asteroids-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19821-asteroids-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/19822-asteroids-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34132-asteroids-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34133-asteroids-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45074-asteroids-atari-2600-screenshot-blasting-asteroids.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45075-asteroids-atari-2600-screenshot-each-level-starts-with-several.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/45076-asteroids-atari-2600-screenshot-eventually-you-have-lots-of.jpg</snapshot3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9243.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Eggomania">					<rom name="atari_2600_eggomania_weird_bird_paddle_1982_u.s._games_corporation_todd_marshall_/atari_2600_eggomania_weird_bird_paddle_1982_u.s._games_corporation_todd_marshall_.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Eggomania</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_eggomania_weird_bird_paddle_1982_u.s._games_corporation_todd_marshall_/atari_2600_eggomania_weird_bird_paddle_1982_u.s._games_corporation_todd_marshall__screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Eggomania is similar to the game Kaboom.

You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle. If you destroy both sets of rods, you earn an extra decoy.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5321-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23592-reactor-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5321-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23593-reactor-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/23594-reactor-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47145-reactor-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47146-reactor-atari-2600-screenshot-particles-attacking.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47147-reactor-atari-2600-screenshot-the-vortex-reactor-core-variation.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/47148-reactor-atari-2600-screenshot-using-a-decoy.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Spacemaster X-7">					<rom name="atari_2600_spacemaster_x-7_1983_20th_century_fox_video_games_david_lubar_11022/atari_2600_spacemaster_x-7_1983_20th_century_fox_video_games_david_lubar_11022.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Spacemaster X-7</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/images/emulation_default.jpg</snapshot1>							<plot>You are an assault ship that was designed to destroy Hyperion military bases.You must shoot the bases enough so that the energy meter at the bottom goes from the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; to the &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;.

They possessed mystical powers capable of both good and evil. The most respected influences in the land were from the good Sorcerers. This fact continually disturbed the evil Wizards, and they eventually decided to use their power to conquer the countryside and enslave its people. They devised a plan to systematically eliminate the good Sorcerers by sending wave after wave of diabolical creatures to ravage the world.As the bravest of the good Sorcerers you have been asked to destroy these forces and save the planet. As a reward for your bravery: whenever you overcome or destroy a creature, you will receive a treasure.Knowing your bravery the Wizards have done everything within their power to keep you from succeeding. They don't believe you will survive their first three waves of evil, but just in case you do they have several surprises waiting, Only you can discover through bravery and talent how evil they can become.To give you more power over the Forces of Evil the good Sorcerers have provided a magical Flying Platform. When you start on your journey you should first catch this elusive platform. You can continue without it, but only the foolish would dare to do so. Once on the Flying Platform you can go anywhere on the screen to avoid or destroy the enemy. The good Sorcerers have also given you four lives to use against the Forces of Evil.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22181-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52328-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52329-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/42246-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101235-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101236-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-screenshot-beginning-a-game.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101237-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-screenshot-better-be-quick.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101238-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-screenshot-mickey-can-run.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101239-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-screenshot-try-to-stop-the.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101240-sorcerer-s-apprentice-atari-2600-screenshot-better-hurry-the.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Space Canyon">					<rom name="atari_2600_space_canyon_aka_space_cavern_1983_panda_100/atari_2600_space_canyon_aka_space_cavern_1983_panda_100.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Space Canyon</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_space_canyon_aka_space_cavern_1983_panda_100/atari_2600_space_canyon_aka_space_cavern_1983_panda_100_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You are in command of a Mark XIV intergalactic starcruiser in an uncharted quadrant of outer space.

The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties).

The game ends when you clear level nine and save the day or lose your last robot arm and the reactor enters meltdown.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28590-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28590-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228741-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-you-start-with-the-robot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228742-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-the-robot-arm-when-closed.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228743-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-avoid-the-fans-as-they.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228744-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-the-deeper-level-you.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228745-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-my-robot-arm-ran-into.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228746-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-if-you-are-not-quick.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228747-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-the-radiation-is-getting.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228748-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-radiation-got-so-high.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228749-china-syndrome-atari-2600-screenshot-the-reactor-is-in-meltdown.jpg</snapshot9>			</game>			<game name="Great Escape">					<rom name="atari_2600_great_escape_aka_asteroid_fire_1983_bomb_-_onbase_ca282/atari_2600_great_escape_aka_asteroid_fire_1983_bomb_-_onbase_ca282.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Great Escape</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_great_escape_aka_asteroid_fire_1983_bomb_-_onbase_ca282/atari_2600_great_escape_aka_asteroid_fire_1983_bomb_-_onbase_ca282_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You're on the road with the rock band Journey! After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds. They will give you temporary invulnerability allowing you to run straight through any obstacles. The game ends when a band member doesn't make it to the escape vehicle before the timer runs out. As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7950-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184519-great-escape-atari-2600-screenshot-shoot-or-avoid-the-meteorites.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184520-great-escape-atari-2600-screenshot-shoot-the-aliens-but-remember.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184521-great-escape-atari-2600-screenshot-you-must-always-avoid-the.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184522-great-escape-atari-2600-screenshot-i-am-exploding.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Blueprint">					<rom name="atari_2600_blueprint_1983_cbs_electronics_tom_didomenico_4l_2486_5000/atari_2600_blueprint_1983_cbs_electronics_tom_didomenico_4l_2486_5000.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Blueprint</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_blueprint_1983_cbs_electronics_tom_didomenico_4l_2486_5000/atari_2600_blueprint_1983_cbs_electronics_tom_didomenico_4l_2486_5000_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>As in the arcade game of the same name, Blueprint gives you, as J.J., three chances to save the damsel in distress from a menacing creature chasing her across the top of the screen. Navigate J.J. through a maze of houses, which contain either a piece of the Rube-Goldberg-esque monster-fighting contraption whose blueprint lies at the bottom of the screen, or a bomb which must be disposed of in short order. Pressing the button will make J.J. run faster, but like so many who spend a lot of time sitting at the Atari 2600, he has a limited amount of &quot;Fast run time&quot; (as indicated by a handy bar graph). Smaller but still pesky monsters also pop out of the bomb disposal pit and try to prematurely start the machine (which shakes it to bits). Once that occurs, those monsters must be lured back to their pit, and the machine must be reassembled. Build the machine in time, and you can blast the creature who's chasing your girlfriend. The Atari 2600 edition simplifies the graphics drastically (though the most elaborate part of the playing field -- the blueprint itself -- is more or less intact), and drops the sound effects back to bare minimum (so much for the game's catchy little jazzy background tunes). There are no control issues, however, and the end result is still quite colorful and a lot of fun.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>10/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17508-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/17508-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26243-blueprint-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52313-blueprint-atari-2600-screenshot-beginning-a-game.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52314-blueprint-atari-2600-screenshot-uh-oh-you-ve-found-a-bomb.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Stone Age">					<rom name="atari_2600_stone_age_1983_cce_c-840/atari_2600_stone_age_1983_cce_c-840.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Stone Age</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_stone_age_1983_cce_c-840/atari_2600_stone_age_1983_cce_c-840_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Your girlfriend Daisy is in trouble! Ollie Org is chasing her across the top of the screen, and you need to come to the rescue. To stop Ollie before time runs out, you need to construct a machine. The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete. If this happens, you will need to drag Pete back to the bomb pit and reassemble all of the machine parts.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26243-blueprint-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52313-blueprint-atari-2600-screenshot-beginning-a-game.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52314-blueprint-atari-2600-screenshot-uh-oh-you-ve-found-a-bomb.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Tooth Protectors">					<rom name="atari_2600_tooth_protectors_1983_dsd-camelot_-_johnson__johnson/atari_2600_tooth_protectors_1983_dsd-camelot_-_johnson__johnson.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Tooth Protectors</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_tooth_protectors_1983_dsd-camelot_-_johnson__johnson/atari_2600_tooth_protectors_1983_dsd-camelot_-_johnson__johnson_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>In this game, you are T.

Monsters have destroyed all your comrades.As the last robot, you must traverse the mine's various levels, gathering spare parts to make more robots (extra lives). You must either avoid the monsters or blow them up with a bomb. After a few seconds, if the monster hasn't hit the bomb, it will explode harmlessly. You can only drop one bomb at a time. If a monster is killed, it will regenerate somewhere in the maze.To deposit your spare parts, you must get to the center top or bottom of any level. To move to another level, hold your joystick button down while moving through the tunnels on either side. You can also use these tunnels, without holding down the button, to quickly get from left or right side of the maze to avoid monsters.To win the game, get to level five and ram each of the three stationary monsters to kill them. You will need at least two spare robots as the ramming will destroy you and the monster.In two player games, player one is the robot, player two is a monster. If the robot runs into the monster being controlled, the monster is destroyed instead of the robot. However, by pushing the joystick button, player two can switch to another monster, allowing the robot to run into an uncontrolled (and therefore deadly) monster.Difficulty switchesLeft switch for the robot, right for the monsters.Set to A to make half speed, B for normal speed.Game variations1P=one player2P=two playerS=spare parts needed for spare robotF=mine levels flood, slowing you down if you enter the water.-T=cannot drop bombs in flooded areas+T=can drop bombs in flooded areasI-mines are invisible except when monsters are exploding by time bombGame 1 1P; S=3; F-TGame 2 2P; S=3; F-TGame 3 1P; S=6; F-TGame 4 2P; S=6; F-TGame 5 1P; S=3Game 6 2P; S=3Game 7 1P; S=2; F-TGame 8 2P; S=2; F-TGame 9 1P; S=3; F+TGame 10 1P; S=3; F+TGame 11 1P; S=3; F+T; IGame 12 2P; S=3; F+T; IScoringDestroy a monster=20 pointsPick up robot part=70 pointsDeposit robot part=lose 70 pointsEvery 1000 points scored up to 4000 raises your power level by one unit.</plot>					<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258981-mines-of-minos-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258982-mines-of-minos-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/258983-mines-of-minos-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184910-mines-of-minos-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-in-the-first.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184911-mines-of-minos-atari-2600-screenshot-a-monster-dying-after.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184912-mines-of-minos-atari-2600-screenshot-the-mine-slowly-floods.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Task Force">					<rom name="atari_2600_task_force_aka_gangster_alley_1987_froggo_fg1003/atari_2600_task_force_aka_gangster_alley_1987_froggo_fg1003.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Task Force</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_task_force_aka_gangster_alley_1987_froggo_fg1003/atari_2600_task_force_aka_gangster_alley_1987_froggo_fg1003_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You are a member of MegaForce and have been sent to the city of Sardoun. Sardoun is under attack and you must defend it. You are armed with the Moto-Fighter, a sort of armed motorcycle with flight ability.When you are on the ground, your missiles fire down and forward, at an angle. When you are in the air, your missiles fire straight ahead.The object is to destroy enemy fighters, destroy or avoid ground-launched rockets, destroy fuel depots and destroy the enemy headquarters. Any enemy fighters that get past you will head to Sardoun and bomb a building. You will see a red flash at the top of the screen with the words &amp;quot;Defend&amp;quot; when Sardoun is in trouble.Every second you are playing, you use one gallon on fuel. If you run out of fuel, you lose a life. You can shoot fuel tanks to replenish. If you destroy all the tanks of that depot, a prize will appear that you can shoot (but may not want to). See &amp;quot;Prizes&amp;quot; for details. Each tank destroyed is worth eighty points and ten gallons of fuel.Each enemy fighter destroyed is worth 100 points.Each ground rocket destroyed is worth 300 points.Each tower of the enemy headquarters destroyed is worth 300 to 600 points. If you get them all, you get one more point.Each tower of Sardoun destroyed is worth 100 to 400 points and ten gallons of fuel each BUT if all the towers are destroyed, you will not be able to get any more points that round and will lose a life at the end of that round.Prizes---------Missile=300 points and ten gallons of fuelMoto-fighter=300 points and ten gallons of fuelEnemy fighter=100 points and 0 gallons of fuel *Ground-launched rocket=70 points and 0 gallons of fuel *Yellow palm tree=400 points and 20 gallons of fuelArrow=0 points and 0 gallons of fuelMan=600 points and 20 gallons of fuel +*=If you shoot the enemy fighter or ground-launched rocket prizes (not the enemies), it will add 7 enemy fighters and 3 ground-launched rockets to the screen, so it is not recommended.+=If you shoot the man prize, in addition to points and fuel, you will get an extra life.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28708-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28708-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/265599-mega-force-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/265600-mega-force-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169428-mega-force-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-screen-here-is-sardoun.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169429-mega-force-atari-2600-screenshot-an-enemy-fighter-approaches.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169430-mega-force-atari-2600-screenshot-a-fuel-depot.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169431-mega-force-atari-2600-screenshot-my-prize.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169432-mega-force-atari-2600-screenshot-i-am-in-the-air-to-take-on.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169433-mega-force-atari-2600-screenshot-i-am-going-the-wrong-way.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Up 'n Down">					<rom name="atari_2600_up_n_down_1984_sega_phat_ho_-_bally_midway_-_beck-tech_009-01/atari_2600_up_n_down_1984_sega_phat_ho_-_bally_midway_-_beck-tech_009-01.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Up 'n Down</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_up_n_down_1984_sega_phat_ho_-_bally_midway_-_beck-tech_009-01/atari_2600_up_n_down_1984_sega_phat_ho_-_bally_midway_-_beck-tech_009-01_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The object is to drive around a twisty course and collect all the colored flags.

Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.</plot>					<genre>Educational</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196311-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-main-menu-set-to-addition.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196312-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-main-menu-set-to-subtraction.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196313-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-main-menu-with-2-player.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196314-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-answering-an-addition-question.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196315-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-eli-moves-up-the-ladder.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196316-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-switched-to-the-counting.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196356-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-we-counted-out-the-answer.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196317-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-eli-got-to-his-ship-and.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/196357-eli-s-ladder-atari-2600-screenshot-we-got-through-20-questions.jpg</snapshot9>			</game>			<game name="Shark Attack">					<rom name="atari_2600_shark_attack_aka_lochjaw_1982_apollo_-_games_by_apollo_steve_stringfel/atari_2600_shark_attack_aka_lochjaw_1982_apollo_-_games_by_apollo_steve_stringfel.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Shark Attack</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_shark_attack_aka_lochjaw_1982_apollo_-_games_by_apollo_steve_stringfel/atari_2600_shark_attack_aka_lochjaw_1982_apollo_-_games_by_apollo_steve_stringfel_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You are a deep sea diver in search of a fabulous treasure of diamonds that spilled from the hold of a Spanish galleon that sank during a fierce storm in the early sixteenth century.

The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet.

You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</plot>					<genre>ActionFlight SimulatorShooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28597-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/28597-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26432-super-cobra-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/135225-super-cobra-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52905-super-cobra-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52906-super-cobra-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52907-super-cobra-atari-2600-screenshot-try-to-bomb-the-fuel-depots.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52908-super-cobra-atari-2600-screenshot-the-tunnel-begins-to-get.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/52909-super-cobra-atari-2600-screenshot-game-over-continue.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Wabbit">					<rom name="atari_2600_wabbit_1982_apollo_ban_tran_ap-2010/atari_2600_wabbit_1982_apollo_ban_tran_ap-2010.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Wabbit</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_wabbit_1982_apollo_ban_tran_ap-2010/atari_2600_wabbit_1982_apollo_ban_tran_ap-2010_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You are a farmer, named Billie Sue, trying to protect your crops.

After experiencing level 5 turbulence I became unconscious.  Upon awaking, I found myself in a time and place unknown to me;  the craft having been completely destroyed.The place I am in is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures.  Through thought waves, the inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical.  As their biological body parts began to age beyond effective use they replaced them with mechanical parts.  Through their will to survive they eventually crated an entire society composed of machines.During this gradual conversion from living matter to machinery a group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive even at the expense of others in the society.  They became know as the Bad-Bugs.  After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds these bugs began attacking the good creatures.Because of my human reasoning and ability as an experienced test pilot the good bugs have asked for my help.  I have been put in command of the best machine-bug on their planet.  My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the Bad-Bugs have creature-machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.  I will, however, be awarded valuable treasures by the good bugs for every enemy I eliminate.  To further complicate my task the good bugs have asked me to rescue the last remaining living creature on their planet, the Pixie.  They have warned me to be very cautious when approaching the Pixy since it is constantly guarded by a killer, machine-bee.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22216-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62988-wabbit-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62990-wabbit-atari-2600-screenshot-you-don-t-have-many-carrots-left.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/62992-wabbit-atari-2600-screenshot-throwing-eggs-at-the-rabbits.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Cosmic Creeps">					<rom name="atari_2600_cosmic_creeps_1982_telesys_don_donyo_ruffcorn_1002/atari_2600_cosmic_creeps_1982_telesys_don_donyo_ruffcorn_1002.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Cosmic Creeps</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_cosmic_creeps_1982_telesys_don_donyo_ruffcorn_1002/atari_2600_cosmic_creeps_1982_telesys_don_donyo_ruffcorn_1002_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Civilization is doomed!

You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again.

A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.If the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety.

You can set up a blockade, force him into a corner or wander off by yourself and hope that he runs into something on his own.Along with the basic SURROUND game, we've added four game features to make things more interesting.

VIDEO GRAFFITI actually allows you to draw on the screen.Surround was one of the nine Atari 2600 launch titles released in September 1977.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>09/01/1977</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21035-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36715-surround-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/21035-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26596-surround-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36716-surround-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26617-surround-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/53315-surround-atari-2600-screenshot-beginning-a-game.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/53316-surround-atari-2600-screenshot-on-a-collision-course-as-the.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/53317-surround-atari-2600-screenshot-diagonal-movement-is-available.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/53318-surround-atari-2600-screenshot-some-game-variations-allow-you.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/53319-surround-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Cosmic Swarm">					<rom name="atari_2600_cosmic_swarm_termite_1982_commavid_john_bronstein_cm-003/atari_2600_cosmic_swarm_termite_1982_commavid_john_bronstein_cm-003.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Cosmic Swarm</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_cosmic_swarm_termite_1982_commavid_john_bronstein_cm-003/atari_2600_cosmic_swarm_termite_1982_commavid_john_bronstein_cm-003_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>In the first stage, the player must fend off meteor showers from all four sides of the screen by pushing the joystick to fire in the desired direction. The second stage requires the player to pilot a shuttle to a planet and use its tractor beam to pick up life forms. While near the planet's surface, planetary defenses will fire at the shuttle. If hit, one previously captured specimen will be freed, forcing the player to retrieve another. After a set period of time, a klaxon will warn of renewed meteor activity, and the player must return immediately to defend the ark.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21347-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/260617-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/260618-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/260616-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169671-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169672-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-screenshot-there-is-a-termite-these.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169673-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-screenshot-these-blocks-are-energized.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169674-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-screenshot-the-refuel-ship-on-the.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/169675-cosmic-swarm-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Quest For Quintana Roo">					<rom name="atari_2600_quest_for_quintana_roo_1984_sunrise_software_1603/atari_2600_quest_for_quintana_roo_1984_sunrise_software_1603.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Quest For Quintana Roo</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_quest_for_quintana_roo_1984_sunrise_software_1603/atari_2600_quest_for_quintana_roo_1984_sunrise_software_1603_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Yucatan Sam explores the temples of Quintana Roo searching for the keys to open the ceremonial vault and acquire the riches inside.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22218-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/31242-quest-for-quintana-roo-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/31243-quest-for-quintana-roo-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/31244-quest-for-quintana-roo-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/63506-quest-for-quintana-roo-atari-2600-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/63507-quest-for-quintana-roo-atari-2600-screenshot-outside-the-temple.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/63509-quest-for-quintana-roo-atari-2600-screenshot-exploring-the.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/63510-quest-for-quintana-roo-atari-2600-screenshot-found-something.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Video Cube">					<rom name="atari_2600_video_cube_aka_atari_video_cube_cce/atari_2600_video_cube_aka_atari_video_cube_cce.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Video Cube</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_video_cube_aka_atari_video_cube_cce/atari_2600_video_cube_aka_atari_video_cube_cce_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Help Hubie the Cube Master solve the magical Atari Video Cube.

One side plays with black, the other with white. Depending on the rank (with the pawn being the lowest and king highest), each piece can move across the board a certain number of spaces or in a specific direction.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1978</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/15889-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/211796-video-chess-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/76519-video-chess-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79108-video-chess-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79110-video-chess-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175579-video-chess-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/175580-video-chess-atari-2600-screenshot-a-game-in-progress.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Word Zapper">					<rom name="atari_2600_word_zapper_word_grabber_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_-_v/atari_2600_word_zapper_word_grabber_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_-_v.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Word Zapper</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_word_zapper_word_grabber_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_-_v/atari_2600_word_zapper_word_grabber_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_-_v_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Word Zapper is a one or two-player, full color, action game with 24 variations, designed to be played on the ATARI (R) Video Computer System (TM) or Sears Video Arcade.The Joystick Controller links you with a most profound vehicle of amusement, the rotary wing Word Zapper.

You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base.The rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1978</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9236-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34738-sea-monster-atari-2600-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/9236-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34739-sea-monster-atari-2600-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34740-sea-monster-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78713-sea-monster-atari-2600-screenshot-try-to-shoot-the-sea-monsters.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78714-sea-monster-atari-2600-screenshot-don-t-let-the-sea-monsters.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78715-sea-monster-atari-2600-screenshot-the-game-in-black-and-white.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Save Our Ship">					<rom name="atari_2600_save_our_ship_unknown/atari_2600_save_our_ship_unknown.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Save Our Ship</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_save_our_ship_unknown/atari_2600_save_our_ship_unknown_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>The game was the first space-related game developed for the Atari VCS.

If something isn't done, the aliens will overrun Earth. It is up to you to destroy the stations by setting their self destructs.You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain doors you encounter in later stations.Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen.

Your weapon: a high-power laser gun as powerful as that of the enemy.  Your advantage: you're sharp enough to duck when they shoot.  It's a hectic chase.  Hop an elevator.  Survive enemy fire.  Fire back. Duck.  Infiltrate...if you dare!</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1982</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22163-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/76445-infiltrate-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/171217-infiltrate-atari-2600-screenshot-starting-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/171218-infiltrate-atari-2600-screenshot-i-m-infiltrating-note-the.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/171219-infiltrate-atari-2600-screenshot-duck.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/171220-infiltrate-atari-2600-screenshot-i-shot-an-assassin.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/171221-infiltrate-atari-2600-screenshot-i-fired-a-shot.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Malagai">					<rom name="atari_2600_malagai_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1001/atari_2600_malagai_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1001.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Malagai</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_malagai_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1001/atari_2600_malagai_1983_answer_software_corporation_-_ty_associates_asc1001_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>You are Commander Harrington &amp;quot;Harry&amp;quot; Crag of the starship &amp;quot;Endless Search&amp;quot;.

At the bottom of the screen is a conveyor belt and a platter will appear at the left side moving towards the right. You are at the top of the screen and need to take cake layers from the oven and drop them onto the platter. The cake layers are different sizes and you must drop them such that each layer is the same size or smaller than the one beneath it. After you have created a cake, you need to top it off with a cherry. If you are unable to successfully create a cake with the layers in the proper order and a topped with a cherry before the platter reaches the right side of the screen, it will fall off the conveyor and you lose a life. The different size cake layers come out of the oven randomly, so if you get a size you don't want, it can be dropped off at the right side of the screen until a layer you do want appears. Although you can build cakes of different sizes, bonus points are earned for building a perfect cake consisting of one large layer, one medium layer, one small layer, and a cherry.

Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser. Naturally, your mission is timed: you will need to make your way to the next detonator before time expires and it explodes! Points are earned by disabling the detonators, destroying enemies and successfully making it past the force fields. </plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1983</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106017-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-imagic-logo.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106018-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-these-force-fields-will.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106019-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-watch-out-for-that-rocket.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106020-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-blast-your-way-through-this.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106021-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-strange-flying-creatures.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/106022-laser-gates-atari-2600-screenshot-be-careful-your-shield-is.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Squeeze Box">					<rom name="atari_2600_squeeze_box_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_vc2002/atari_2600_squeeze_box_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_vc2002.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Squeeze Box</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_squeeze_box_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_vc2002/atari_2600_squeeze_box_1982_u.s._games_corporation_henry_will_iv_vc2002_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Squeeze Box is a single player, full color game designed to be played on the Atari Video Computer System or the Sears Video Arcade.

If your web line goes too close to a villian, it will be cut and Spider-Man will fall. If you're careful, you can swing back and forth to capture the villians for bonus points.

The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them. They appear one at a time at random spots on the screen. After you pop all ten balloons, you must dock in the space dock to end the race.The difficulty switches are not used.

The ship controls in a rather Asteroids-like way, in that you push left or right to rotate and press fire to thrust. Once you stop thrusting, the ship does not immediately stop, although it will slow down on its own. To stop sooner, you have to face away from the direction you are traveling and thrust.First, you must pass a set number of hurdles. If there is a single hurdle, you must pass on the side indicated by the arrow. If there are two hurdles, you must pass in between them. If there are three, you can pass through them or go around. If you hit a hurdle, you must go back to the last successfully passed hurdle and do it again to continue.After the hurdles, you must pop ten space balloons by running in to them.

The object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8 game board. This is accomplished by moving your pieces diagonally forward on the board; an opponent's piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponent's piece, you must make that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes 'kinged' allowing movement both forwards and backwards. The game can be played by one player against the computer (with three skill levels available) or two players against each other.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1980</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/53020-checkers-atari-2600-media.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134566-checkers-atari-2600-screenshot-the-beginning-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134567-checkers-atari-2600-screenshot-move-the-x-to-select-a-checker.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134568-checkers-atari-2600-screenshot-uh-oh-the-red-player-has-just.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134569-checkers-atari-2600-screenshot-gameplay-in-black-and-white.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Encounter At L-5">					<rom name="atari_2600_encounter_at_l-5_megalon_invasion_paddle_1982_data_age_da1001/atari_2600_encounter_at_l-5_megalon_invasion_paddle_1982_data_age_da1001.bin" size="0"/>					<description>Encounter At L-5</description>					<snapshot1>https://archive.org/serve/atari_2600_encounter_at_l-5_megalon_invasion_paddle_1982_data_age_da1001/atari_2600_encounter_at_l-5_megalon_invasion_paddle_1982_data_age_da1001_screenshot.png</snapshot1>							<plot>Using an anti-matter launcher, you must defend the starbase L5 against a non-stop horde of blue Megalyte warrior ships and their death ships.

After you get through these, you switch to a side view of the ship and face left or right. Robot interceptors will come from the sides and must be destroyed then fish force fields (yes, fish force fields) will come from the top, moving down and you must shoot the fish-shaped devices to destroy them.
