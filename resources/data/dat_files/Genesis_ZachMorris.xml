It was originally released in Japan in 1988 as Mega Drive, then in North America in 1989 as Sega Genesis, and in Europe, Australia and other PAL regions in 1990 as Mega Drive. The reason for the two names is that Sega was unable to secure legal rights to the Mega Drive name in North America. The Sega Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the Sega Master System with which it has backward compatibility. The controversy over games like Mortal Kombat in the United States forced Sega to create the first content rating system for video games, the Videogame Rating Council, rather than have the games heavily censored. The rating system allowed Sega to ship games with little to no censorship and gave it a competive edge when the same game was released by Nintendo. The success of those games eventually forced Nintendo to join its rating system.Developer:  SegaManufacturer:  SegaCPU:  Motorola 68000Memory:  64K work RAM (68000), 64K video RAM, 8K work RAM (Z80)Graphics:  Yamaha YM7101Sound:  Yamaha YM2612 5 channel FM and 1 channel FM/PCM, Texas Instruments SN76489 4 channel PSG (Programmable Sound Generator)Display:  320Ã—448Media:  CartridgeMax.

In order to keep the duo busy, he also frees the Joker, Two-Face and the Mad Hatter, each one with their own agenda. The Joker celebrates his birthday wreaking havoc in Gotham and stealing diamonds, Two-Face tries to take over the city from above, and Mad Hatter is creating a robot army in his surreal lair.The game can be played by two players simultaneously; one player with Batman, and the other with Robin. Both characters are identical in terms of playability, and both use batarangs, bolas, or shirukens in long-range attacks, while using melee attacks at short range. There are four levels consisting of several stages, mostly of a straight left-to-right traverse to the end where the boss awaits. In some levels the game switches to a side-scrolling shooter, in which the players must control the Batwings.The game is regarded as being extremely difficult to complete, and also known for showcasing some of the most impressive special effects on the Mega Drive/Genesis. It also features a soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. This accounts for the relatively high quality of Kyd's compositions, as well as the fairly simple FM synthesized nature of the game's sound effects.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<releasedate>02/10/1995</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9415-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/9415-2.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9415-2.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/9415-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/9415-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9415.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Adventures of Mighty Max, The (USA)">					<description>Adventures of Mighty Max, The (USA)</description>					<rom crc="55f13a00" name="Adventures of Mighty Max, The (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Max is a kid who possesses a magic cap that allows you to travel across different world and to save people who get in trouble in other dimensions.

She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<studio>Hi-Tech</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1992</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/4273-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/4273-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4273-1.png</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/4273.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Barbie Vacation Adventure (USA) (Proto)">					<description>Barbie Vacation Adventure (USA) (Proto)</description>					<rom crc="10e0ba69" name="Barbie Vacation Adventure (USA) (Proto).zip" size="1048576"/>					<videoid>FmOwL-sB_bo</videoid>					<plot>Barbie Vacation Adventure es un juego de accin, lanzado al mercado en 1994.Developer (Desarrollado) By: SOFTWARE CREATIONSPublisher (Publicado) By: HI TECH EXPRESSIONS</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/27454-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/27454-1.png</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27454-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27454-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/27454.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken ~ Streets of Rage (World)">					<description>Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken ~ Streets of Rage (World)</description>					<rom crc="bff227c6" name="Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken ~ Streets of Rage (World).zip" size="524288"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/27454-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/27454-1.png</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27454-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27454-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/27454.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken ~ Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A)">					<description>Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken ~ Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A)</description>					<rom crc="4052e845" name="Bare Knuckle - Ikari no Tetsuken ~ Streets of Rage (World) (Rev A).zip" size="524288"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/27454-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/27454-1.png</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27454-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/27454-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/27454.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Barkley Shut Up and Jam 2 (USA)">					<description>Barkley Shut Up and Jam 2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="321bb6bd" name="Barkley Shut Up and Jam 2 (USA).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>This game is a sequel to Barkley: Shut Up and Jam!.

During timeouts, and at half-time, the player has a choice to make substitutions. When a player makes 2 baskets in a row, the announcer says &quot;He's heating up&quot;, and if he makes 3 baskets in a row without the other team scoring, he says &quot;He's on fire!&quot;, which makes it easier to score.In the season mode, the player can pick from 44 teams, and then play a 20 game season against quality competition. In the tournament mode, 16 teams compete for a chance to win the national championship. The player also has the ability to edit teams and players. The game itself is not realistic, as players can easily make full-courts shots and occasionally, players get struck by lightning as they dunk.

As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<studio>Electronic Arts</studio>					<releasedate>08/09/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/489-2.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/489-2.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/489-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/489-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/489-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/489-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/489-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/489-g.jpg</banner1>					<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/489-g2.jpg</banner2>			</game>			<game name="Incredible Crash Dummies, The (USA) (Beta)">					<description>Incredible Crash Dummies, The (USA) (Beta)</description>					<rom crc="623a920f" name="Incredible Crash Dummies, The (USA) (Beta).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>At a time when computer games were being blamed for violence, bad language, epilepsy and everything else the moral majority needed a scapegoat for, Virgin gave us: The Road Safety Game.

Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life.

It features John Madden on the cover. The AI has been boosted and can now hurry in two-minute drill situations, spike the ball, and cover the receivers with better efficiency.Among the innovations in Madden 96, the Create A Player feature was added, which included many position specific mini-games that would determine the ability of the player.The game also was the first in the Madden series to include secret &quot;classic&quot; teams, which were unlocked by playing any of the 28 pre-expansion NFL franchises in the playoffs and by winning Super Bowl XXX with that team (a rather easy feat as the playoff tournament system allows a player to abort the game while in the lead and still win). The 28 pre-expansion teams were each represented by a classic era equivalent, which ranged from 1960 (Philadelphia Eagles) to 1986 (New York Giants), although all players identified as number-only. Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers, having debuted in 1995, did not have a secret classic team revealed in this manner, nor did the All-Madden team. However, Carolina was attached to the blank slate NFLPA team used for Create-A-Player, and Jacksonville and All-Madden hid the &quot;superteams&quot; with players named after the developers; these teams were accessed using unstated cheat codes.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<studio>EA Sports</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4490-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Madden NFL 97 (USA, Europe)">					<description>Madden NFL 97 (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="c4b4e112" name="Madden NFL 97 (USA, Europe).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>Madden NFL '97 reloads with an arsenal of new and classic features to field the most complete Madden ever.

He would have his Shadow Priests, led by Shang Tsung, revive his former Queen Sindel, who unexpectedly died at a young age. However, she wouldn't be revived in the Outworld. She would be resurrected in the Earthrealm. This would allow Shao Kahn to cross the boundary lines and reclaim his queen.When Sindel is reincarnated in Earthrealm, Shao Kahn reaches across the dimensions to reclaim her. As a consequence of his action, the Earthrealm becomes a part of the Outworld, instantly stripping billions of their souls. Only a few are spared, as Raiden protects their souls. He tells them that Shao Kahn must be stopped, but he cannot interfere; due to his status, he has no power in Outworld, and Earthrealm is partially merged with Outworld.Shao Kahn has unleashed extermination squads to roam throughout the Earthrealm and kill any survivors. Also, Raiden's protection only extends to the soul, not to the body, so his chosen warriors have to fight the extermination squads and repel Shao Kahn. Eventually with his final defeat, every human on Earthrealm comes back.Mortal Kombat 3 follows Mortal Kombat II and shares continuity with both Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and Mortal Kombat Trilogy which were both updates of this game.

Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld.

The objective is to not let the blocks overflow, let Pac-Man eat the ghosts, and make lines to shorten the amount of blocks on the board. When Pac-Man eats a ghost, the Fairy Meter goes up. Once full, a fairy will eventually be dropped. Once the fairy comes to a stop by landing on anything, it waves its wand and every ghost in the eight lines below it will disappear, often resulting in numerous lines being completed and simplifying the board. Once the fairy disappears, the score bonus is given, and gameplay continues.Pac-Attack can also be played in 2-player mode. Player 1 must eat Blinky, while Player 2 must eat Sue, the purple ghost from Pac-Mania. As players eat ghosts and complete lines, they will drop ghosts on their opponent's board, messing up their board and bringing them closer to the top. This game can even be played in puzzle mode. The object of this mode is to smash all 100 stages. If you get a Game Over, all the regular blocks appear with red crosses on them, while Blinky and Sue over backwards laughing silently.

Pac-Man himself walks around in a cartoon world and interacts directly with the player, as well as with objects and other characters. The player cannot control Pac-Man directly, but instead can direct his attention in various directions, and is armed with a slingshot that can be used to strike certain objects, including Pac-Man himself.Pac-Man's mood varies throughout the game, usually in response to his environment or the player's actions, and generally his mood affects his actions and his willingness to cooperate with the player; the varieties of &quot;bad&quot; moods can at time compromise the player's ability to progress. There are a few instances, however, where Pac Man is required to be angry. Hitting objects with the slingshot can often get Pac-Man to look at that object and piece together parts of the puzzle he is currently trying to solve - for example, hitting a door may cause Pac-Man to go inside a house to discover a clue. But beware - a few objects when hit can also produce disastrous (and humorous) results. Hitting a trash can on a city street at the wrong time, for example, can cause a cat to jump out and attack Pac-Man.Throughout the game, Pac-Man is occasionally harassed by the four ghosts from the classic Pac-Man games. When this happens, Pac-Man is paralyzed by fear and eventually faints, unless the player gives him a power pellet. Then Pac-Man becomes Super Pac-Man for a brief time and flies around, eating the ghosts. In some cases, the ghosts may leave behind important objects.</plot>					<genre>AdventurePuzzle</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Namco</studio>					<releasedate>08/26/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/674-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/674-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/674-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Pac-Mania (USA, Europe)">					<description>Pac-Mania (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="74bba09b" name="Pac-Mania (USA, Europe).zip" size="262144"/>					<plot>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man.

The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump.

Gameplay is similar to the games before it in the series, with combat still being turn-based and battles randomly occurring. Players must explore both overworld maps and dungeons in order to progress through the game.Phantasy Star III mostly follows the traditional roleplaying game formula seen throughout the series, with exploration of several 2-D worlds, character recruitment, and random enemy encounters using a turn-based battle system. Unlike previous games, the series staple of &quot;techniques&quot; play a diminished role in combat, which is ironic considering the role they play in differentiating the game's two major factions - with techniques being exclusive to Layans, and viewed as &quot;evil magic&quot; by the Orakians.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<releasedate>04/21/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/679-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/679-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/679-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/679-4.jpg</fanart4>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/679-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/679-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/679-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/679-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/679-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/679-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/679-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/679-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/679-g.png</banner1>					<videoid>JVCDO2khgfY</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Phantasy Star IV (USA)">					<description>Phantasy Star IV (USA)</description>					<rom crc="fe236442" name="Phantasy Star IV (USA).zip" size="3145728"/>					<plot>The time: Space Century 3240.

The game ends when the player retires, at which point he is given a position in his future life, from beggar to King's adviser, based on accumulated wealth, land, rank, marital status, and other accomplishments.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventureStrategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>MicroProse</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/969-2.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/969-2.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/969.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Pit-Fighter (World)">					<description>Pit-Fighter (World)</description>					<rom crc="1e0e0831" name="Pit-Fighter (World).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>The player begins Pit-Fighter by choosing one of the three playable characters, who all have different moves, speed, and power.

Ranger X is equipped with a jet pack and an assortment of weapons. The jet pack allows for short periods of flight, the duration of which is limited by the jet pack's temperature. Upon overheating, the player must land and wait for cool down. Alongside Ranger X's standard pulse rifle, the player has access to various special weapons including a flamethrower and homing attacks. Unlike the pulse rifle, the special weapons drain a power bar, which can only be recharged when Ranger X is in a bright light source. This special arsenal can be increased by collecting power ups scattered across the levels. On certain levels, the player may also control a supporting vehicle - an Ex-Up, such as Indra - a futuristic motorcycle, a premise described as &quot;RoboCop on a Harley&quot;.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/681-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/681-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/681.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>ZmkyHnh-lWM</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Rastan Saga II (USA)">					<description>Rastan Saga II (USA)</description>					<rom crc="c7ee8965" name="Rastan Saga II (USA).zip" size="524288"/>					<plot>Rastan Saga 2 is the sequel to Rastan, containing the same hack-em'/slash-'em gameplay as the original.

Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to wage war.The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the hostiles from the air, land and sea. Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike series. Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar systems become affected.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<studio>Time Warner</studio>					<releasedate>11/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/4593-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4593-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>FZKsQ09qOk4</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Ren &amp; Stimpy Show Presents, The - Stimpy's Invention (USA)">					<description>Ren &amp; Stimpy Show Presents, The - Stimpy's Invention (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d9503ba5" name="Ren &amp; Stimpy Show Presents, The - Stimpy's Invention (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>In one player the player controls either Ren or Stimpy and the computer controls the other character who will simply follow; however, the player can swap the character they control at almost any time during game play.

You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.The vehicles you have at your command includeSpeeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing rightStinger: A prototype &quot;next generation&quot; attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drillSea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transportRemote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switchesDarwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Cosmo</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/4612-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4612-1.png</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Sega Channel (USA) (General Instrument) (Program)">					<description>Sega Channel (USA) (General Instrument) (Program)</description>					<rom crc="5df93f11" name="Sega Channel (USA) (General Instrument) (Program).zip" size="524288"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/4612-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4612-1.png</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Sega Channel (USA) (Scientific Atlanta) (Program)">					<description>Sega Channel (USA) (Scientific Atlanta) (Program)</description>					<rom crc="bc79b6ed" name="Sega Channel (USA) (Scientific Atlanta) (Program).zip" size="262144"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/4612-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4612-1.png</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Sega Channel Demo (USA) (Program)">					<description>Sega Channel Demo (USA) (Program)</description>					<rom crc="2abae889" name="Sega Channel Demo (USA) (Program).zip" size="524288"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/4612-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4612-1.png</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Senjou no Ookami II ~ Mercs (World)">					<description>Senjou no Ookami II ~ Mercs (World)</description>					<rom crc="16113a72" name="Senjou no Ookami II ~ Mercs (World).zip" size="1048576"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/4612-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4612-1.png</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Sesame Street Counting Cafe (USA)">					<description>Sesame Street Counting Cafe (USA)</description>					<rom crc="0a4f48c3" name="Sesame Street Counting Cafe (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Counting Cafe is an educational game based on the popular children's show Sesame Street.

Some towns have a headquarters where the player can inspect and talk with his allies. While roaming through town or moving throughout the world, one can find both visible and hidden treasures and interact with certain objects.Each ally unit is represented by a character with a background and personality. Some of these characters are hidden, requiring specific events to occur before they will join the force. Each ally unit also has a class, which defines the abilities for that unit. These abilities range from what type of weapons they can use to what kind of spells they can learn. Units can become stronger by fighting enemies and performing various actions which gives them experience points (EXP), which allow them to gain levels. Once a unit reaches level 20, that character has the ability to advance to more powerful class through promotion. Some characters have two different classes they may be promoted to, one of which is only accessible using a special hidden item.Battles take place on a square grid, and each unit occupies a single square. Battle is turn-based. Each turn, a character can move and perform one action: either attack, cast a spell, or use an item. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping an item during the turn, do not count as actions.The battle is won if all enemies are defeated, or if the enemy commander is defeated. If Bowie is defeated in combat or withdraws, the battle is lost and the player is returned to the nearest town, where he can recover his allies and fight the same battle again.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<releasedate>10/19/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/184-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/184-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/184-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/184-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/184-5.jpg</fanart5>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/184-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/184-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/184-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/184.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shining in the Darkness (USA, Europe)">					<description>Shining in the Darkness (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="4d2785bc" name="Shining in the Darkness (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Shining in the Darkness is a &quot;dungeon-crawler&quot; RPG.

As the satellite falls back to the Floating Island, landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled woodland.Sonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the powerful Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch Base defeat.At Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to Sky Sanctuary.At Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn't collected all seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master Emerald.If all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik's machine is destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island becomes airborne once again. If the player didn't collect all the Super Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal. If all Emeralds are collected, the player sees the Sonic 3 and Knuckles logo featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<releasedate>10/18/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/733-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/733-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/733-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/733-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/733-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/733-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/733.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>3brewFc7kAE</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Sonic &amp; Knuckles + Sonic The Hedgehog (World)">					<description>Sonic &amp; Knuckles + Sonic The Hedgehog (World)</description>					<rom crc="e01f6ed5" name="Sonic &amp; Knuckles + Sonic The Hedgehog (World).zip" size="2621440"/>					<plot>When Sonic 3 is locked-on to the original Sonic the Hedgehog or Sonic Compilation via Lock-On Technology, the result is a deceptive &quot;No Way!&quot; screen.

He resolves to once again save a world by fighting off the entire force himself.There are a total of 12 stages, each with its own end boss.

Although the player can select any stage to start the game at, all twelve levels must be completed before moving on to the Final Chapter stage.

After the player completes this level Spider-Man learns that the evil Arcade has kidnapped Storm, Cyclops, Wolverine, and Gambit. The player must successfully complete each character's level (each set in Arcade's deadly &quot;Murderworld&quot;) in order to get to control Spider-Man in a final battle with Arcade.After completing each stage, the player controls each hero as they fight in similar-designed mini-levels themed after the &quot;Behind-the-Scenes&quot; of Murderworld. The only character to have a significant change is Storm, who now walks, shoots multiple bolts of lightning rapidly and calls upon gusts of wind, and jumps about four times the height of the other characters. The last level takes place inside a large room, where Arcade chases Spider-Man back and forth in a large Arcade-shaped robot, which operates like a Matryoshka Doll, until Arcade is finally defeated. The X-Men stand-by at the edges of the room, occasionally attacking on their own.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<studio>LJN</studio>					<releasedate>08/19/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/699-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/699-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/699-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Spider-Man .

Skate had arrived at home from school and was shocked to find his house in ruin and his older brother missing. Attached to the front door was a picture of Adam chained to a wall at the feet of Mr. X. The criminals began to retake the streets once more. Beatings and lootings took place regularly and in broad daylight. Chaos reigned in the city, far worse than before.Realizing that &quot;Mr. X&quot; and his syndicate has returned for revenge against him, Blaze, and Adam, Axel wastes no time in telling Blaze about the unexpected situation and Blaze herself is determined to help Axel out in defeating &quot;Mr. X&quot; and rescuing Adam. Accompanied by Adam's young brother Skate and Axel's friend, a professional wrestler named Max Thunder, Axel and Blaze set forth on a rescue mission, which will take them from the city all the way to &quot;Mr. X&quot;'s hideout on a desolate island.</plot>					<genre>ActionFighting</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<releasedate>12/20/1992</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/694-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/694-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/694-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/694-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/694-2.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/694-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/694-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/694.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>nCElWRi_xnE</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Streets of Rage 3 (USA)">					<description>Streets of Rage 3 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d5bb15d9" name="Streets of Rage 3 (USA).zip" size="3145728"/>					<plot>After being defeated twice, Syndicate crime boss Mr. X has started a research company called RoboCy Corporation to act as a cover for his illegal activities. The world's best roboticist, Dr. Dahm, has been brought in to help him create an army of realistic robots to replace important officials from the city. With the replacements in place, Mr. X plans to run the city using a remote control device. His criminal organization, The Syndicate, has strategically placed bombs around the city to distract the police while the city officials are dealt with.Dr. Zan discovers what the research is really for and knows the Syndicate must be stopped. He contacts Blaze Fielding with the details of The Syndicate's plan. Blaze quickly contacts her old comrades Axel Stone and Adam Hunter for a task force to bring down The Syndicate once and for all. Axel quickly joins the task force, but Adam can't make it (due to his own assignments from within the police) and sends his young brother, Eddie &quot;Skate&quot; Hunter instead.

The player takes control Strider Hiryu, the youngest elite-class Strider in the organization. Hiryu is summoned by the organization's second-in-command, Vice Director Matic, to assassinate his friend Kain, who has been captured by hostile forces and has become a liability to the Striders. Instead of killing him, Hiryu decides to rescue Kain from his captors. With the help of his fellow Strider Sheena, Hiryu uncovers a conspiracy between a certain faction of the Strider organization led by Matic himself and an unknown organization known simply as the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (headed by a man named Faceas Clay) which involves the development of a mind-control weapon codenamed &quot;Zain&quot;. In the course of finding and destroying these Zain units, Hiryu learns that the faction of conspirators is headed by Vice Director Matic himself. Hiryu eventually tracks Matic to an orbiting space station where the two Striders face off; after a brief battle Hiryu bests Matic and kills him. Afterwards Hiryu locates and destroys the last of the Zain units.In the epilogue, it is revealed that though Hiryu was asked to return to the Strider organization he instead opted to retire. The final credits show him sheathing his weapon and walking away.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Capcom</studio>					<releasedate>07/01/1989</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/702-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/702-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/702-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/702-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/702-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/702.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>dumAeg4FrRE</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Strider Returns - Journey from Darkness (USA)">					<description>Strider Returns - Journey from Darkness (USA)</description>					<rom crc="42589b79" name="Strider Returns - Journey from Darkness (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/702-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/702-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/702-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/702-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/702-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/702-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/702.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Sub-Terrania (USA) (Beta)">					<description>Sub-Terrania (USA) (Beta)</description>					<rom crc="3a1022d1" name="Sub-Terrania (USA) (Beta).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>The game consists of 10 missions.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Electronic Arts</studio>					<releasedate>03/03/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/4641-1.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/4641.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Super Battleship (USA)">					<description>Super Battleship (USA)</description>					<rom crc="99ca1bfb" name="Super Battleship (USA).zip" size="524288"/>					<plot>Super Battleship is a Board game, developed by Synergistic Software and published by Mindscape Inc., which was released in 1993.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<studio>Mindscape</studio>					<releasedate>02/18/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/549-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/549-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Super Hang-On (World) (En,Ja) (Rev A)">					<description>Super Hang-On (World) (En,Ja) (Rev A)</description>					<rom crc="3877d107" name="Super Hang-On (World) (En,Ja) (Rev A).zip" size="524288"/>					<plot>Super Hang-On is a 1987 motorcycle racing arcade game from Sega, and the sequel to the acclaimed Hang-On.

Enemies defeated in this way turn into doves, cards, or other harmless objects depending on the enemy. After defeating the boss of each level, a new magic spell is learned, allowing the pair to traverse the next level; i.e. flying on a magic carpet or going underwater in an air bubble. This was one of the few Genesis games to feature voice samples.The gameplay changes depending on if the player selects Mickey or Donald, in a one player mode, or if two people want to control both characters at once. For instance, Mickey can squeeze through certain gaps, while Donald must find a different route; if both are playing, Mickey can pull Donald through the gap. Either can stand on the others' shoulders to ascend higher, and lower a rope to pull the other up.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<releasedate>12/18/1992</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/139-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/139-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/139-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/139-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/139-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/139.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>F1GDvDX6y3g</videoid>			</game>			<game name="World Series Baseball (USA)">					<description>World Series Baseball (USA)</description>					<rom crc="57c1d5ec" name="World Series Baseball (USA).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>World Series Baseball is the first game in the long-running series.
