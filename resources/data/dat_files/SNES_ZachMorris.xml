In Japan and Southeast Asia, the system is called the Super Famicom (officially adopting the abbreviated name of its predecessor, the Family Computer), or SFC for short. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was Nintendo's second home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other consoles at the time. Additionally, development of a variety of enhancement chips (which were integrated on game circuit boards) helped to keep it competitive in the marketplace. The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era despite its relatively late start and the fierce competition it faced in North America and Europe from Sega's Genesis console. The SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era, and although Nintendo no longer offers factory repairs/replacement or accessories for the console, it continues to be popular among fans, collectors, retro gamers, and emulation enthusiasts, some of whom are still making homebrew ROM images.Developer:  NintendoManufacturer:  NintendoCPU:  16-bit 65c816 Ricoh 5A22 3.58 MHzMemory:  128kbGraphics:  N/ASound:  8-bit Sony SPC700Display:  512 Ã— 239Media:  CartridgeMax.

All three types of players have the same basic abilities and vary only on their personal strengths. In many cases, human players are better than their robot counterparts. One major difference between the human and robot characters is that the robot characters can blow up (or lose all their power) if they are worked too hard during a game. That can happen if you constantly make them dive for a ball, run extra bases, or even if they get hit by a pitch. Under no stress whatsoever, some robots, especially pitchers, will naturally run out of power as the game progresses. When this happens, they will lose all their abilities and be useless, both offensively and defensively. When that occurs, you can either power them up or replace them with another person on the roster. Human players do not blow up, but human pitchers can tire out. When they are tired, they will pant heavily and throw the ball very slowly. This can be remedied by either an upgrade or, as in real baseball, switching to a relief pitcher.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<studio>SNK</studio>					<releasedate>03/12/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/304-1.png</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/304-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/304-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/304-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/304.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="3 Ninjas Kick Back (USA)">					<description>3 Ninjas Kick Back (USA)</description>					<rom crc="f2ee11f9" name="3 Ninjas Kick Back (USA).zip" sha1="B619576A51A3968E243028A830A455D40CF92E78" size="2097152" status="verified"/>					<videoid>18Hcd8P61Wc</videoid>					<plot>You first saw Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum on the silver screen when their martial arts skills and extreme exploits saved the honor of Grandfather Mori and defeated an evil arms dealer.

The mission is to neutralise the offensive forces of the Zarak army, who have recently invaded a smaller neighbouring country. The Zarak army has many ground units, including tanks, stinger-missile launchers, SCUD missiles and armored vehicles.To accomplish the ultimate goal of defeating the Zarak army, players venture out on numerous missions (called &quot;sorties&quot;) that have varied and specific objectives. Typically, various installations such as radar sites, air bases or ground units are the target. Other missions include disabling an oil-pipeline and destroying SCUD launchers before they fire. Pre-mission screens ask the player to select from the two planes. Then,  the player can specify the armament to carry into the sortie. Air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles are available for each of the planes. Here, a strategic choice between countering either air units or ground units has to be made, as each area (of which there are eight) is patrolled by opposing enemy F-15 jets.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>SETA</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/305-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/305-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/305-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/305-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/305.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Aaahh!!!

This is an arcade game with many different activities to participate in.In each level, Barbie starts by going left to right with forced scrolling.  She has a default speed and can speed up as well.  She must avoid moving obstacles by moving up and down and controlling her speed.  If she hits one, she loses a chance and it's game over if she runs out of chances.  She must pick up items which grant point bonuses and extra chances.There is also a camera item to pick up which brings you to a magazine cover shoot.  You are shown a cover with barbie wearing an outfit which is themed to the level.  You must then go to her dressing room and dress her in a matching outfit.  You are also given separate control of the colors of three different components and must match these.  You are awarded points for each correct match.When you reach the right side of the level, you are given a runway practice.  This consists of four positions on the runway floor labeled to tell you which button you must press at each one.Barbie then goes back through the level right-to-left.  On the return trip, there is a handbag to pick up.  This brings you to another magazine cover.  You then go to a makeup mirror where you must match Barbie's hairstyle, earrings, eyeshadow and lip and nail color to the cover.  Again, you are awarded points for each item which you get correct.When you reach the left side of the level, you must then do Barbie's runway walk that you were given earlier.  You are awarded points for each station at which you perform the correct move.Barbie then continues to the next level.  There are a total of four: Barbie driving down the street, skating on the beach, walking through a ski resort and walking through the park.</plot>					<genre>Life Simulation</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Hi-TechExpressions,Inc.</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3370-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3370-1.png</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3370.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>B-omo-seoZc</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Barkley Shut Up and Jam!

Like the original version of Battletoads, this game is also known for its extreme difficulty, and is incredibly tough to finish, even for experienced gamers.</plot>					<genre>ActionFighting</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Tradewest</studio>					<releasedate>06/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1606-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1606-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1606-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1606.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>WjzP6u6ayjc</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Battletoads-Double Dragon (USA)">					<description>Battletoads-Double Dragon (USA)</description>					<rom crc="8b18ac01" name="Battletoads-Double Dragon (USA).zip" sha1="BF56F12BDDE3E2233D7FFCAF4825B10D92632B77" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>When a battle-cruiser the size of a city and called the Colossus smashes out of the moon, its laser cannon glowing menacingly, you can bet it ain't gonna be makin' no social calls...You can bet it's gonna be creating some bad n' crazy mayhem on good ol' planet Earth -  'specially when you know that the dreaded Dark Queen and the shady Shadow Boss are on board just rarin' to rock n' roll...The dastardly duo are about to unleash their most monstrous plan yet - from their secret lunar base they intend to launch an invasion that'll make them masters of the world...Neutralized by deadly glooming rays, Earth's forces are powerless... that ist, until the Dragons join the 'Toads!Take a 'toadacious trip with the dream ticket as those terrific twins Billy and Jimmy Lee team up with Zitz, Rash and Pimple against the combined might of the gruesome twosome and their mindless minions, Big Blag, Abobo, Robo-Manus and Roper, in a 'toadally terminal new adventure!So let's get mad, bad n' crazy once again as the BATTLETOADS join DOUBLE DRAGON in THE ULTIMATE TEAM!</plot>					<genre>ActionFighting</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Tradewest</studio>					<releasedate>10/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2772-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2772-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2772-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2772-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2772.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bazooka Blitzkrieg (USA)">					<description>Bazooka Blitzkrieg (USA)</description>					<rom crc="6810aa95" name="Bazooka Blitzkrieg (USA).zip" sha1="3A1238F88CAFE6E25B07A10682FB93BDD559F771" size="524288"/>					<plot>The Sylon Corporation was busy at work on an army of robot soldiers that would save thousands of lives in the event of a war.

The Beast must battle through such levels as the dungeon and the main hall battling giant spiders, rats, rogue candle monsters, live gargoyle statues, and enchanted brooms, while collecting books for points (since Belle likes books) and magic mirrors that allow the Beast to see further into the current level to anticipate what challenges await.</plot>					<genre>AdventurePlatform</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Hudson Soft</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3170-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3170-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3170-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3170-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Beavis and Butt-Head (USA)">					<description>Beavis and Butt-Head (USA)</description>					<rom crc="15cf4bd5" name="Beavis and Butt-Head (USA).zip" sha1="00F649F44816FF432EE2B29D7290F2E9544857B5" size="1572864" status="verified"/>					<plot>Based on the successful cartoon 'Beavis and Butt-head', the game is very faithful to the series.It game stars at the home of Beavis and Butt-head - and from there you can choose to go to different locations like: Turbo mall 2000, the street, burger world, hospital, GWAR concert and more... your main goal is to find money to the GWAR concert.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Viacom New Media</studio>					<releasedate>07/01/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3860-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3860-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3860-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3860-2.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3860-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3860.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>Vj9b-hiUQ-M</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Bebe's Kids (USA)">					<description>Bebe's Kids (USA)</description>					<rom crc="bda2e412" name="Bebe's Kids (USA).zip" sha1="3E73BD7965EEE7DDD40BD60AE51ECBCA8D85DE0F" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Bb's Kids is an action-oriented Super NES video game that is loosely based on the movie of the same name.

You can bark at these opponents to scare them away.

As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches). The fighters movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.</plot>					<genre>FightingSports</genre>					<studio>Electro Brain</studio>					<releasedate>11/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17856-1.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/17856.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Brain Lord (USA)">					<description>Brain Lord (USA)</description>					<rom crc="ac443d87" name="Brain Lord (USA).zip" sha1="1398A08D66980F8A9F73E0AE20ED5C518B3859E8" size="1572864" status="verified"/>					<plot>In &quot;Brain Lord&quot;, you play a young traveler and warrior who is searching for his long lost father.

Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<studio>Sony</studio>					<releasedate>11/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2853-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2853-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2853-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2853.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Clue (USA)">					<description>Clue (USA)</description>					<rom crc="a4fbe827" name="Clue (USA).zip" sha1="956B48F602A24DD3D5D64195F6366FA0B68F0738" size="524288" status="verified"/>					<plot>In addition to play by the original rules, Clue has an additional mode that allows movement via &quot;points.&quot; Each turn begins with nine points and every action the player takes costs points. The player can only do as many things as he has points. For example, moving from square to square costs one point, making a suggestion costs three points.

The game is loosely based on the 1991 television American film Adventures in Dinosaur City by Smart Egg Pictures, and borrows many of the film's characters, settings, and basic plot while providing its own unique art direction and style. Initially released in July 1992 for Japanese audiences, the game was later made available in North America the following September. The game centers on Timmy and his friend Jamie, two young children who are accidentally transported to a world resembling prehistoric Earth populated by anthropomorphic dinosaurs. While a device which will allow them to return home exists in this environment, a critical component has been stolen by Mr. Big, leader of a gang of Neanderthals known as The Rockeys, leaving the player to guide Timmy or Jamie to his castle to retrieve it. They are assisted by Rex, a Tyrannosaurus, and Tops, a Protoceratops, each with their own play-styles.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Irem</studio>					<releasedate>09/01/1992</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/25614-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25614-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/25614-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/25614-2.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Dirt Trax FX (USA)">					<description>Dirt Trax FX (USA)</description>					<rom crc="61a86c7f" name="Dirt Trax FX (USA).zip" sha1="D36E3E949C46939029C82B19B2F99A098EFDAB76" size="524288" status="verified"/>					<plot>The player can choose between eight different riders with unique characteristics and four bikes ranging from 50cc to 500cc.

The game is composed of a series of stages, in which the sea organism slowly evolves into an amphibian, and later a land-only creature.

The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Laguna</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3609-1.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3609.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>7Uxn9vuEGmE</videoid>			</game>			<game name="FIFA Soccer 96 (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Sv)">					<description>FIFA Soccer 96 (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Sv)</description>					<rom crc="7566347d" name="FIFA Soccer 96 (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Sv).zip" sha1="07E91BDE033B5A53A5723C9DB5F3649A99ACDB08" size="1572864" status="verified"/>					<plot>&quot;Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum systemFIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup.

Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects) have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life. Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map. As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four players.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>DTMC</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3618-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="FireStriker (USA) (Beta)">					<description>FireStriker (USA) (Beta)</description>					<rom crc="bbbbabb6" name="FireStriker (USA) (Beta).zip" sha1="9DF853DDE743616FD09F34631D0C4C849E163969" size="1048576"/>					<plot>A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and watercompeted for the Trialight, a weapon created by the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a Firestriker.

The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet.

Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost.

The golfer with the least amount of strokes wins.Tournament mode has golfers competing in either one day (18 holes) or two days (36 holes) of golf.

The player takes control of Frodo Baggins, who must find companions for his quest. The game's locations, individual objectives, missions, and quests are structured quite differently from those of the computer release. Most of the quests involve retrieving items for various NPCs, thus advancing the narrative.The gameplay is also different from the computer version, being less heavy on character development (role-playing), and more oriented towards combat, which is action-based in this release. Though up to three characters join Frodo on his quest, one player can control only one character at a time.

If you are lucky, you might even score an Ace. If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return. Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do. When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance.

You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels.

Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Enix</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3204-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3204-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="King Arthur's World (USA)">					<description>King Arthur's World (USA)</description>					<rom crc="99bd1fe1" name="King Arthur's World (USA).zip" sha1="55D037575AFFE9A1ACAE30A395BB4680E76A3E0B" size="524288" status="verified"/>					<plot>This is a 2D side scrolling strategy game.

Concerned, that a new evil has appeared, the two set out to confront it at the temple. This is just the beginning of a new adventure that will take them Goemon and his partner all across Japan; into moutain villages, amusement parks, castle fortresses and more!Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages, enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.At the end of each village is an &quot;action area&quot; which changes the game in a complete side-scroller. One or both players can enter this place, filled with obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center). These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player game, characters can ride piggy-back on one another, to avoid getting stuck by a scrolling screen.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3211-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3211-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>tmv19VzLfW0</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (USA)">					<description>Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (USA)</description>					<rom crc="777aac2f" name="Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past (USA).zip" sha1="6D4F10A8B10E10DBE624CB23CF03B88BB8252973" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<videoid>a6DpoeuJ4ww</videoid>					<plot>Venture back to Hyrule and an age of magic and heroes.

Its events take place ninety-nine years prior to it, and it explains the origin of the series' antagonists, the group of super-humans known as the Sinistrals. The player controls the ancestor of the first game's protagonist, the swordsman Maxim. After having encountered a mysterious woman named Iris, Maxim goes on a journey to find other heroes who would help him to stop the Sinistrals from destroying the world.Like the first game, Rise of the Sinistrals is a Japanese-style turn-based RPG with many puzzle elements thrown in. The game makes extensive use of puzzles in its dungeon layouts; various items and accessories must be used to solve them. It also features a &quot;Capsule Monsters&quot; system; monsters can be summoned to fight alongside the party in battles. They would evolve when fed weapons, armor, or special fruits. Unlike in the first game, there are no random battles in the dungeons: all the enemies are visibly moving on-screen.</plot>					<genre>PuzzleRole-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Natsume</studio>					<releasedate>08/31/1996</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3218-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3218-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="M.A.C.S.

Within the year, the design had been standardized and Reploids were being mass-produced.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Capcom</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-10.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-2.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-3.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-4.jpg</fanart5>					<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-5.jpg</fanart6>					<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-6.jpg</fanart7>					<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-7.jpg</fanart8>					<fanart9>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-8.jpg</fanart9>					<fanart10>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/143-9.jpg</fanart10>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/143-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/143-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/143-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/143-g.jpg</banner1>					<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/143-g2.png</banner2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/143.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>wd2NqblSmIY</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Mega Man X2 (USA)">					<description>Mega Man X2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="947b0355" name="Mega Man X2 (USA).zip" sha1="637079014421563283CDED6AEAA0604597B2E33C" size="1572864" status="verified"/>					<plot>Six months and 13 days after defeating Sigma, X assumes leadership of the Maverick Hunters.

In the year 21XX, the threat of the Mavericks had been neutralized thanks to Doppler's technology, which prevented the Mavericks from going berserk. The reformed Reploids had formed a utopia near their new mentor called Doppler Town. It seemed that all was well, until the former Maverick Reploids suddenly reverted and once again began causing trouble. Dr. Doppler was held accountable, and X and Zero were sent out to contain the new threat. Once Zero and X defeat Dr. Doppler and his forces, Dr. Doppler snaps out of it and realizes all the damage that he has done. He reiterates that Sigma's true form is now a computer virus, and he realizes that he was corrupted to create a new body for him. X seeks out Sigma after thanking the doctor. After an intense battle, the Sigma Virus in its pure form chases X in an attempt to possess him. After X finds himself at a deadend, one of two things may happen. In the main ending, Zero takes Dr. Doppler's true antivirus and uploads it onto his sabre offscreen. He rushes in to save X just in time and causes Sigma to explode, taking out the lab as they evacuate. However, if Zero was injured during the game, the worse scenario occurs - Dr. Doppler instead uses his own body as the antivirus and sacrifices himself for the greater good.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Capcom</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1016-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1016-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1016-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1016-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1016-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1016-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1016-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1016.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>oNoozJJkfh0</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Metal Combat - Falcon's Revenge (USA)">					<description>Metal Combat - Falcon's Revenge (USA)</description>					<rom crc="c3131b49" name="Metal Combat - Falcon's Revenge (USA).zip" sha1="DA88FC5830DDB0CDF8FFC2E8340A607D0AD8EAA1" size="2097152" status="verified"/>					<plot>Following the events of Battle Clash, the Battle Game Chiefs had been defeated.

Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<studio>Bandai</studio>					<releasedate>09/01/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3226-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3226-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3226-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>_tf66VHVbEo</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Fighting Edition (USA)">					<description>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Fighting Edition (USA)</description>					<rom crc="460b0a60" name="Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Fighting Edition (USA).zip" sha1="80A856DBA0F12FD1E9EDED75D219B854910E990F" size="1572864" status="verified"/>					<plot>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition is a game directly based on the world-known television series. In this game, you can choice among 8 playable characters: the Power Rangers' Zords (Thunder Megazord, Mega Tigerzord, Ninja Megazord, Shogun Megazord) or some of their known villains (Lipsyncher, Silver Horns, Goldar, Lord Zedd). The title offers 3 game modes: Story Mode (1-Player only), Fighting Mode (2-Player) and Trial Mode (a survival mode for 1-Player only).During Story Mode, the goal is to defeat all the 4 Zords, the 4 villains up to Lord Zedd and last, but not least, Ivan Ooze. In this mode, you can opt by the Thunder Megazord (formed by the 5 original Rangers) or by the Mega Tigerzord (formed in conjunction with the White Ranger). The Fighting Mode is an traditional 2-Player head-to-head combat, where you can choose any of the 4 Zords or even the 4 villains. Trial Mode is a Endurance-like option, and the main goal is to win as many battles as possible using only 1 health bar (that will be partially replenished after each battle).As well as many fighting games, you can take advantage of a Power Bar (here, it fills automatically): if you execute a Super Move when this bar is flashing, it will be cause more damage, besides increasing 1 level. Once you having reached its maximum status, it's possible to execute power-up versions of Special Moves or even unleash high-damage blows (Super Moves).</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Bandai</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5612-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>lFTI2KdUhcc</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie (USA)">					<description>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie (USA)</description>					<rom crc="e3ef6201" name="Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - The Movie (USA).zip" sha1="82FBE365BC96FE3F03C3EB12E1620910B15F01F9" size="1572864" status="verified"/>					<plot>The Power Rangers stripped of their Mighty Morphin Powers and forced to flee Earth?

The game was done by the same people as Super SWIV, and as such, the graphics are incredibly polished. The game was apparently too ambitious, and was never fully complete (although the game engine and graphics certainly indicate that it is close).The game follows a demolition robot known as Mr. Tuff. After the entire population of earth escapes to the planet Utopia, the army robots take over the world. It is up to Mr. Tuff to save the world for the peaceful domestic robots. The levels involve standard platform action, though there are a few shooter-esce hoverboard levels. Each world is set up into standard levels and a boss level.***Mr. Tuff is a cancelled platform game that was in development by Sales Curve in 1995, for the Super Nintendo. The project was almost finished but for some reasons it was never officially released in the end.

The events in the game are based off of the actual game show events with the main goal being to score as many points as possible while trying to beat the clock.In Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced around.  There are three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, Attack is lacrosse and Spiral where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging tire.Action Sports is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and is divided into two events:  Basic Training involves poles, swinging ropes and punching bags and Tornado Run which adds water jets and moving platforms.  Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and a chance at the bonus round.The final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant indoor mountain the player must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents.  The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.There is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event.  Elastic lets the players compete against each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be played through alternating play.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Viacom New Media</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5713-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Nigel Mansell's World Championship Racing (USA)">					<description>Nigel Mansell's World Championship Racing (USA)</description>					<rom crc="162252e2" name="Nigel Mansell's World Championship Racing (USA).zip" sha1="03591006E7296AB3F0608FAA97E03CE725EB0F14" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Timing smiled on Gremlin with this licensed Formula 1 simulation, as Nigel's long quest for a championship had finally come good.

J.T. Robbins, whose only objective of the game is to escape an island. After shooting his commanding officer, Robbins is imprisoned and eventually sent to the island Absolom as a war criminal, from where there is no escape possible. To do this still, the player must explore the island with side-scrolling platform gameplay for clues, finding items and combining them to make weapons and traps.  Robbins can talk to some prisoners to help him in his quest, but he must also avoid violent prisoners, either by attacking them with punches or kicks or using traps and stealth to bypass them.

These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan. Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe &amp; assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move, bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Koei</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5715-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Nolan Ryan's Baseball (USA)">					<description>Nolan Ryan's Baseball (USA)</description>					<rom crc="1919baff" name="Nolan Ryan's Baseball (USA).zip" sha1="E52E1D8C8825D52C9FA65A39C3B28F83D1DF59AE" size="524288" status="verified"/>					<plot>Nolan Ryan's Baseball is a baseball video game based on the retired baseball player Nolan Ryan.

One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.

A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre. Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps. The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts. Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the &quot;gold&quot; points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>U.S. Gold</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5719-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="On the Ball (USA)">					<description>On the Ball (USA)</description>					<rom crc="50ad3fe8" name="On the Ball (USA).zip" sha1="0C54BD1D43CA3BD6A56F55FCF8F4D97466864D92" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named &quot;inertia.&quot;  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.(Now if only someone could explain the &quot;Camel&quot; part - referencing the Japanese title.)</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Taito</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5720-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Operation Europe - Path to Victory 1939-45 (USA)">					<description>Operation Europe - Path to Victory 1939-45 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="f84c2bb6" name="Operation Europe - Path to Victory 1939-45 (USA).zip" sha1="2C08D0DAF70A44A4D73D16C803A0C323CD4D01E8" size="1310720" status="verified"/>					<plot>The game is an historical simulation of the European and North African theaters of World War II.

An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5722-1.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/5722.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>AHgcXVqxNG4</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Oscar (USA)">					<description>Oscar (USA)</description>					<rom crc="cdf463c0" name="Oscar (USA).zip" sha1="7D981C08B8F418F80C1B8D565EB46323D087F6AB" size="524288" status="verified"/>					<plot>Your name is Oscar.

Anyway, the game closely resembles &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you.

Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a &quot;wall&quot; on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Namco</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5772-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Pac-In-Time (USA)">					<description>Pac-In-Time (USA)</description>					<rom crc="44375368" name="Pac-In-Time (USA).zip" sha1="ED8CEA2DCF6742CDB7C22C6440C74768D7040B3C" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Everybody knows what/who Pac-Man is from his heyday in the '80s, but this time, we're getting a whole new adventure of our little eater.

In addition to combinations of standard attacks, jump-, run-  and throwing attacks, all characters can also block attacks, perform single heavy attacks, special attacks that consume a certain amount of energy and super attacks. Super attacks damage all enemies on-screen, but can only be used twice per continue.

Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken.

The game plays like a standard 2D fighter: you can punch, kick, and jump on you opponents, but the fights are not entirely 2D, since you can also take a few steps vertically.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Kaneko</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1992</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3237-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3237-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Power Piggs of the Dark Age (USA)">					<description>Power Piggs of the Dark Age (USA)</description>					<rom crc="e945530d" name="Power Piggs of the Dark Age (USA).zip" sha1="9DB093A46938FE14FDC044A0758618D4B43FB449" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>The player is put in the role of Bruno, an anthropomorphic pig who has the task to defend his land which is currently under siege by wolves.

Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour.

Prince of Persia 2 is, however, more combat-heavy than its predecessor. In the first game, enemies appear only occasionally and are always alone, while in the sequel, up to four enemies may appear at once, sometimes flanking the player, and may even be instantly replaced by reinforcements when they are killed. As in Prince of Persia, the trick is to complete the game under a strict time limit that passes in real time. Lives are unlimited, but time cannot be regained except by reverting to a previously saved game. In other areas, more significant improvements have been made. The graphics are far more complex than the simple look of the game's predecessor, the areas explored are larger, and the variety of backdrops is greater.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Titus</studio>					<releasedate>10/01/1996</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2198-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2198-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-8.jpg</snapshot8>			</game>			<game name="Prince of Persia 2 - The Shadow &amp; the Flame (USA) (Beta)">					<description>Prince of Persia 2 - The Shadow &amp; the Flame (USA) (Beta)</description>					<rom crc="5b793cc3" name="Prince of Persia 2 - The Shadow &amp; the Flame (USA) (Beta).zip" sha1="D03ED1DF157DA2C1C7A8B2C78BFEDF8D9CCF5753" size="2097152"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2198-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2198-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2198-8.jpg</snapshot8>			</game>			<game name="Pro Quarterback (USA)">					<description>Pro Quarterback (USA)</description>					<rom crc="6910626d" name="Pro Quarterback (USA).zip" sha1="7B9E36C5391B761189EA39EA3EEF24D4292B3D01" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Pro Quarterback is a football game featuring 27 different teams.

Everything from treacherous right turns to gasoline is simulated as the player tries to win the FIA World Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. The player can play a single race (non-championship Formula One race) or a season mode where the winner takes all, and the losers can wait until next year. The game allows players to customize their racing vehicle. Suspension, wings, and brakes among other things can be altered to gain lap times in addition to positions on the track. Winning is near impossible unless the player can successfully tinker with his vehicle from the beginning of the race week. Even the weather can betray the player; having the wrong tires will make the car skid out. The controls and overall gameplay are relatively simplistic for a driving simulator game. Aguri Suzuki even appears in the game as the most expert driver. The graphics in the game look like they come out of an 8-bit console system. In 1993, Aguri Suzuki F-1 Super Driving was released for the Game Boy handheld, exclusively in Japan. In this game, the player can control a kart and a Formula One car.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Absolute Entertainment</studio>					<releasedate>08/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2544-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2544-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Relief Pitcher (USA)">					<description>Relief Pitcher (USA)</description>					<rom crc="2f48ff14" name="Relief Pitcher (USA).zip" sha1="1036B526252BC91DB3F298FD68778EC635702CD0" size="2097152" status="verified"/>					<plot>This baseball game has the following game modes: Starting Pitcher - 9 Inning game for either one or two players, Relief Pitcher - 12 game season for one player, and Relief Pitcher - Best of 7 series for two players.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Left Field Productions</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5807-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Relief Pitcher (USA) (Beta)">					<description>Relief Pitcher (USA) (Beta)</description>					<rom crc="cfed1ea8" name="Relief Pitcher (USA) (Beta).zip" sha1="8E665CEF3007C77B94636448295C09D0209E768A" size="2097152"/>					<plot>This baseball game has the following game modes: Starting Pitcher - 9 Inning game for either one or two players, Relief Pitcher - 12 game season for one player, and Relief Pitcher - Best of 7 series for two players.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Left Field Productions</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5807-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Ren &amp; Stimpy Show, The - Buckeroo$!

The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball. The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode.

He hopes to create new functions in nature that will remove the pollution from the Earth before it is too late. Unfortunately Dr. Bruford's experiments go wrong and genetic monsters are unleashed upon the world. The only thing that can stop these creatures are Dr. Bruford's previous achievement: Genetically enhanced warriors known as the Run Sabers. Two of the Run Sabers, Sheena and Allen are ready to activate.Run Saber is a side-scrolling platform game similar in gameplay to Strider. Players assume the role of one or both of the Run Saber characters. Choosing either Sheena with her Ice powers or Allen with his Thunder powers, players must defeat mutant monsters. The Run Sabers can move side to side, jump in the air, attack with a sword, climb along walls or roofs, slide across the ground and drop-kick. Additionally, each character has a special move, which damages everything on the screen with either Ice or Lightning, and which can be activated by collecting orb power-ups. Other power-ups include small health, large health, extra life and a larger sword. Players progress through 5 different levels, often encountering powerful boss and miniboss mutant creatures.</plot>					<genre>ActionPlatform</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<releasedate>06/08/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5486-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5486-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/5486-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/5486-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/5486-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/5486-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<videoid>ocbnMvUkJ0U</videoid>			</game>			<game name="S.O.S - Sink or Swim (USA)">					<description>S.O.S - Sink or Swim (USA)</description>					<rom crc="dd329f85" name="S.O.S - Sink or Swim (USA).zip" sha1="1F55E0541297D9B95035614728FAE08B3FC80614" size="524288" status="verified"/>					<plot>Your name is Kevin Codner  rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and &quot;shipsmarts&quot;.In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.Each level has a certain &quot;save limit&quot;, meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Mindscape Inc.</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5856-1.png</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Samurai Shodown (USA)">					<description>Samurai Shodown (USA)</description>					<rom crc="2e614a53" name="Samurai Shodown (USA).zip" sha1="3844A37927AE12D4077EE7188048B4CBB9958448" size="4194304" status="verified"/>					<plot>In early Japan, a man named Shiro Tokisada Amakusa preaches a heretic religion.

Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Electric Dreams</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1992</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6129-1.png</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Sporting News Baseball, The (USA)">					<description>Sporting News Baseball, The (USA)</description>					<rom crc="315af696" name="Sporting News Baseball, The (USA).zip" sha1="13DFB9435F4D6227F1D484C6E76D1172AEC91F6A" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>The Sporting News Baseball doesn't feature a Major League license, but does feature the MLBPA license, meaning that it features some of the best players of the time, such as Ken Griffey Jr., Daryl Strawberry and John Smoltz, to name a few.

The main portion of the game is Tour mode, where the player visits a series of different levels representing different countries of the world. Each player's character is armed with a gun, which shoots a vertical cable. If this hits a bubble, it will cause it to split in two. Upgrades allow two cables to be shot at once, or the ability to stick a cable to the ceiling where it will cling for a few seconds, bursting any bubble that hits it.Players must clear each screen of bubbles before progressing to the next one. The largest bubbles will have 4 degrees of splitting before clearing. Many level layouts have ladders, barriers and breakable bricks in part of the screen, affecting movement of both the player and the bubbles. Faster bubbles in the shape of diamonds also bounce around the screen going any which way rather than bouncing in predictable arcs like the other bubbles.Several power-up tokens are also available, offering features such as splitting all bubbles down to their minimal size, freezing the bubbles for a few seconds, and various different weapons. Monsters also enter the screen periodically, which hit the bubbles and take them down a size, and can often be directed by the cable weapon.In addition to the main Tour mode, the game also features Panic mode, in which a succession of bubbles are thrown at at the players.

As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6154-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>kPfWLuJzA_Y</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Super Conflict (USA)">					<description>Super Conflict (USA)</description>					<rom crc="f254d5cf" name="Super Conflict (USA).zip" sha1="6AD80097738A6C8E3611DBBD959828E89624A930" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Super Solitaire is a SNES version of the classic solitaire card game with 12 varieties of play (Klondike, Free Cell, Golf, Cruel, Pyramid, Stonewall, Doesn't Matter, Aces Up, Florentine, Poker, Canfield and Scorpion).

There is an animation in the screen above the map that shows the results of their movements and attacks.Battle mode kicks in when the player locates an enemy on the map, like Biollante or Mechagodzilla, and is taken to a side-scrolling cinematic-style battle where the player must use punches, tail whips and the famous fire breath to drain the energy of the opposing monster.  However, the Fighting Spirit system is present which is in a sense a morality meter where the player must pick the right attacks at the right time in order to connect certain attacks.  Choosing the wrong attacks or failing to connect with them will cause the meter to drop and make Godzilla more vulnerable to attack.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Toho</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6161-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6161-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Super High Impact (USA) (Beta)">					<description>Super High Impact (USA) (Beta)</description>					<rom crc="6c771cbd" name="Super High Impact (USA) (Beta).zip" sha1="A4B749231991EB44B5EE8D9E979A33D3B84EC97C" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Super High Impact was one of the most hard hitting football games before the NFL Blitz series was created, with 18 teams and over 30 plays per team.

In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears. A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.The game contains familiar role-playing elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells, as well as activate various bonuses on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack and Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.</plot>					<genre>ActionRole-Playing</genre>					<studio>Culture Brain Inc.</studio>					<releasedate>04/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2672-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2672-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Super Nova (USA)">					<description>Super Nova (USA)</description>					<rom crc="460def25" name="Super Nova (USA).zip" sha1="465BD5A08BDBCFB8154522E7F516D3A74E608CAF" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>The intergalactic menace Belser has been long-defeated.

Once again it is up to the U.S.S. Freedom Forces to get into their Turrican Assault Suits and drive back the forces of &quot;The Machine&quot;.Similar to it's predecessors, Super Turican features large levels that are crammed with secrets and can be explored freely and in any direction. To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Seika Corp</studio>					<releasedate>05/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6177-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6177-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6177-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6177-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6177-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6177-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6177-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<videoid>D2wu70VFTSU</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Super Turrican 2 (USA) (Beta 2)">					<description>Super Turrican 2 (USA) (Beta 2)</description>					<rom crc="5e550e27" name="Super Turrican 2 (USA) (Beta 2).zip" sha1="C8BDC5CEE51EF93B43468F268C4BE25C66A858CD" size="2097152"/>					<plot>Super Turrican is back, and once again the USS Freedom Forces have to prevent the evil Machine from harming innocent civilizations. This requires the player to jump and shoot his way through large levels filled with lots of enemies.

Far off in the Horsehead Nebula, a group of shapeshifting aliens known as World Watchers assign planets for their Watchers to protect.  A purple alien, Widget, is an apprentice assigned with the job of protecting Earth.  Along for the ride is his intelligent sidekick, Mega Brain.Super Widget is a platform game for the Super Nintendo, based on the cartoon show, Widget.  It shares some similarities to the game Felix the Cat in how the main character upgrades their weapon as they collect more power-ups.Widget navigates through various worlds as he travels to Earth, picking up 'W' coins - 100 earns him an extra life.  There are also special power ups in different categories - these allow Widget to transform into a variety of different creatures, each with their own different ranged attack.  As the player collects more power-ups of the same type (up to three), they change into more powerful creatures.  If the player gets hit while transformed, they change back to the previous creature.  If they get hit while as normal Widget, they lose a life.At the end of each world is a boss character.  These are larger enemies that require learning their basic pattern, avoiding their attacks, and then firing back with your own.  After defeating the boss, the player is graded based on how long it took to complete the level and their combat skills.  They are then awarded 'Watcher Experience' based on these grades.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3914-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3914-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Suzuka 8 Hours (USA)">					<description>Suzuka 8 Hours (USA)</description>					<rom crc="54740b9b" name="Suzuka 8 Hours (USA).zip" sha1="90A418A1D0A65C32EA8945C6496602F0D11514A5" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>This recreation of one of the classic motorbike races uses Super FX technology for the rotating graphics.

Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.

Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6231-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6231-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Taz-Mania (USA) (Rev 1)">					<description>Taz-Mania (USA) (Rev 1)</description>					<rom crc="b17230ae" name="Taz-Mania (USA) (Rev 1).zip" sha1="CCA964090DB6270C625265FA9757EC1FAFEE64EB" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>This version of Taz-Mania is different from the side-scrolling versions by Sega, in this version the player controls Taz from a third-person perspective.

The player controls the T-800 terminator, a cyborg from the future, who travels to the year 1995 to protect John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against machines, from being killed by another terminator, the highly advanced model T-1000. This adaptation of the movie is essentially a side-scrolling action game, with both melee combat and shooting; there are also driving sequences between the side-scrolling levels, which mainly consists of avoiding pursuers and safely arriving to the next destination. T-800's default weapon is a pistol, but he can later acquire other weapons such as a shotgun, a mini-gun, etc. The &quot;good terminator&quot; can also use kicks and punches to dispose of the enemies. As in the movie, T-1000 appears frequently and must be fought and incapacitated, but can not be permanently killed until the ending part.Another objective the player must complete is collecting various robotic parts that could lead to a construction of a new terminator. These parts must be sought out and destroyed, to make this new technique impossible.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>LJN</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6256-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6256-1.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/6256.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Terminator, The (USA)">					<description>Terminator, The (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d71e6c3b" name="Terminator, The (USA).zip" sha1="402723FF8E42DFE3139ECB792BD53F225BEEB103" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>The SNES game based on James Cameron's classic 1984 film is an action game where the player takes the role of Kyle Reese, sent from the future to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator.The game has two kinds of levels: in several scrolling platform levels, Reese runs and jumps, shooting at Terminators (in the future war level that begins the game), street punks or policemen.The film's chase scenes are recreated in two driving sequences.

The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or &quot;line&quot; without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS.

Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching colors by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line).Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send &quot;garbage blocks&quot; to the other player's playfield.Tetris Attack provides several single-player modes. Story Mode takes the player through the game's main plot, pitting the player against a series of foes in a head-to-head match. The objective is to cause the computer-controlled player to lose. In Endless Mode, the player is challenged to play as long as possible with a continuously rising stack of blocks, which increases in speed over time. Timed Mode challenges the player to score as many points as possible within a two-minute time limit, and Stage Clear mode takes the player through a series of stages in which the objective is to clear blocks below a set line. A Puzzle Mode is also provided, which presents the player with a number of puzzles where he or she must clear all of the blocks in a set number of moves (Blocks do not rise in this mode).In addition to the game's single-player modes, Tetris Attack also provides several multiplayer modes that are essentially two-player variants of the single-player modes. One or both human players may be substituted with a computer-controlled player with a selectable difficulty level.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>11/03/1996</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3281-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3281-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3281-g.png</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3281.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>W-kXJa_5R4Y</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends (USA)">					<description>Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends (USA)</description>					<rom crc="bb4cd5a4" name="Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends (USA).zip" sha1="7B03D25216C4021FC5A1A3C1A04012D2C1E1638F" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Control Thomas the Tank Engine as he's got to take special trips he has to organise: Take children to the seaside, medicine to the hospital or deliver the mail.

We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the film, and challenges him to a &quot;duel across time.&quot; Platforming action follows across multiple periods of history.The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The &quot;timing,&quot;, both in terms of controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through the entire game.There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the &quot;FBI... Get on it!&quot; background theme in the first few levels.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Cryo Interactive</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6301-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>qWd_XvMUrrg</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Timon &amp; Pumbaa's Jungle Games (USA)">					<description>Timon &amp; Pumbaa's Jungle Games (USA)</description>					<rom crc="341c6fb0" name="Timon &amp; Pumbaa's Jungle Games (USA).zip" sha1="28D76E1CC2B4F5399863B291D94E16600BF0BDA6" size="1572864" status="verified"/>					<plot>Play different arcade games with The Lion King characters Timon and Pumbaa:Hippo Hop - Help Timon travel across the river while collecting the grubs for Pumbaa's grill.

One of the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic, but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them.

Something went wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Advanced Productions</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6331-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="War 3010 - The Revolution (USA)">					<description>War 3010 - The Revolution (USA)</description>					<rom crc="98c974be" name="War 3010 - The Revolution (USA).zip" sha1="13722922C00F8B3E0462D5C549732D86A258F2CC" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>An alien race named Kyllen has enslaved humanity. On the planet Joyec, rebels managed to take the Kyllen by surprise and seize one of their battle fleets. The player must now guide their efforts in trying to throw over the Kyllen. War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Advanced Productions</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6332-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Wario's Woods (USA)">					<description>Wario's Woods (USA)</description>					<rom crc="2d1004f1" name="Wario's Woods (USA).zip" sha1="1D814276114BD5CAFB6AB041305CE83E8093DC10" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist. Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down, the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will clear all monsters of the diamond's color.There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.There are 5 different modes of play: a &quot;Round Game&quot; in which Toad has to clear numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player mode, a &quot;Time Race&quot; mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the computer, but the &quot;Round Game&quot; mode features two modes of play: one that includes boss-fights on every level ending with a 9.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6333-1.jpg</boxart2>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/6333-g.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Warlock (USA) (Beta 2)">					<description>Warlock (USA) (Beta 2)</description>					<rom crc="af7c1a95" name="Warlock (USA) (Beta 2).zip" sha1="A38DDD4ED4DEC43B426C29A0098D7C406FDD88E3" size="2097152"/>					<plot>When the sun aligns with the moon once every millennium, druid guardians summon their magic of their runestones to prevent the rebirth of the Warlock.

Frank Baum's classic story as strongly influenced by MGM's 1939 musical.  To a lesser degree, individual levels adapt locations from the 1993 Wizard of Oz Animated Series by DIC by using settings from the series, such as Time Town.The game is a platform adventure, which highly encourages exploration.  The action is split into four worlds.  In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a companion the witch must be fought.  After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different attacks and abilities.  Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as Toto also.All levels can be revisited once passed and doing so required both for the purposes of stocking up on items and to find the Emerald City tickets which are required to enter the final area.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Seta</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6295-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6295-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6295-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/6295.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Wizardry V - Heart of the Maelstrom (USA)">					<description>Wizardry V - Heart of the Maelstrom (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d8fddd76" name="Wizardry V - Heart of the Maelstrom (USA).zip" sha1="7E07A2DE8874E807060A2D18429818386AC7DA8E" size="1048576" status="verified"/>					<plot>Despite the defeat of Trebor, Werdna, and L'kbreth, dark times once again threaten the kingdom of Llylgamyn.

Genosha's government is apparently using Apocalypse to bring their mutant population under control. However, Xavier suspects Apocalypse to follow his own plans and sends five X-Men, Cyclops, Wolverine, Psylocke, Beast and Gambit, to investigate.X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse combines the gameplay of a side-scrolling brawler like Final Fight with elements of a platformer, that is, players have to fight various enemies and survive the occasional jumping-puzzle. Most levels also feature mid- and end-bosses in form of robots, monsters or known Super-Villains.Each character has unique abilities and special moves: Cyclops uses his Optic Blast to attack enemies from a distance, Wolverine can climb walls, Psylocke is very agile and the best jumper of the team, Beast can cling to the ceiling while Gambit throws explosive cards at his enemies. Special moves are quite similar to those found in Street Fighter II (Wolverine has a Dragon-Punch-style attack and Gambit's Double Kick is virtually identical to M. Bison's Scissors Kick), and require similar button combinations.While most stages are unique for each character, some can be played with any of the X-Men.

Their fighting is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a much more potent alien race. The 3 planets find that they are able to set aside their differences long enough to battle their shared menace.Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the threat. There is a robot named Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that one character receives a health refill.Each character has special attributes that help the team. For example, Panthera's relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the other 2 characters can not travel.
