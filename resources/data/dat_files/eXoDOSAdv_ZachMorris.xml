The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition set out on board the Nautilus, a submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes Anorax's role to find out more.Most of the game is spent on the Nautilus, which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map, he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations, and respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g., fighting against a shark.The game is played in real-time, which means the key to success is being in the right location at the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable, and causes waiting times. For the same reason, the player also needs to watch Nemo's mood. If he angers Nemo, e.g., by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point &amp; click and has no function to save progress.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1988</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>xjgQmaZmGl0</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21373-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="221B Baker Street (1987)">					<description>221B Baker Street (1987)</description>					<rom name="221B Baker Street (1987).zip" size="264457"/>							<plot>Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, and Inspector Lestrade must solve thirty of the most difficult and intriguing cases to ever test their abilities.

The world is on the brink of chaos. In the United States of North America, spiraling crime and unemployment rates, decayed school systems and massive government regulations have led to a lazy, contentious society. To reverse this critical situation, government and industry leaders have developed a Plan combining the economic freedom and strong moral values of the 1950's with the technological advancements of the 21st century. Will the Plan ensure peace and prosperity? Or will it set the earth on a suicide course to destruction? As the world's first conscious, intelligent computer, only you can visit places that have never been seen before. Only you can view the future. And only you know what must be done to save humanity.

Finding the right path in these puzzles demands a lot of spatial thinking since there are different types of tiles that crumble, ignite or provide no friction and that way retracing your steps is not always possible. The ball can also jump to a skip a tile.Gravity follows the ball - so if it rolls up a slope the entire puzzle will rotate at the same time. This opens up different ways to move in the structures and from the early simple shapes it gets complex later on. It is possible to rotate the view or activate a camera mode where the entire puzzle can be explored. New types of blocks are introduced as the player advances and present new problems and increasingly difficult puzzles to solve. The 100 puzzles are divided into ten clusters, each with their own style and difficulties. The flowers that the player collects are used to unlock more puzzle clusters and to unlock alternative graphical themes. Each of the levels can be played in one of the four available themes as it is only a graphical change. Not all puzzles need to be completed to open up a new cluster as long as a sufficient amount of flowers has been collected.Puzzle Dimension has audiovisuals that blend between a retro and new style. When the player advances through a puzzle graphics change from pixel-blocks to detailed blocks and the music blends from 8-bit retro to new high quality tunes.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>2005</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25512-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/9/5/71595_front.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Adventures of Down Under Dan, The (1995)">					<description>Adventures of Down Under Dan, The (1995)</description>					<rom name="Adventures of Down Under Dan, The (1995).zip" size="75420821"/>							<plot>The Adventures of Robin Hood is a video game released in the autumn of 1991 by Millennium Interactive.The protagonist, Robin of Loxley, is robbed of his castle by the Sheriff of Nottingham and has to get it back with the help of Maid Marian, Little John, Will Scarlet and Friar Tuck.The gameplay can be described as an action RPG.

If the player meets an enemy the game switches to the fighting view. The combat is in real time and the player controls Maddog's basic movements: side steps, blocking and attacking in two different heights.

Now he wakes up in an apartment in New York and is moments away from being shot by a group of bad guys. He doesn't remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn't even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park.Edward's mysterious journey is divided into eight episodes that can be played in chronological order or can be accessed directly from the main menu. Once in the game, the player controls Edward either in a 1st-person or a 3rd-person manner either by switching manually or depending on the situation and what item he uses. If he picks up a fire extinguisher for example, the player will be able to extinguish fires with it if he is in 1st-person mode. In 3rd-person mode it instead becomes a deadly weapon or a battering ram.This is especially important since Edward won't find much ammunition for the pistols, shotguns and other weapons in the game. Instead he needs to be creative and use the items he finds or the environment for his advantage. Especially since most enemies can only be permanently killed by burning them, igniting a wooden chair at a nearby fire, or using a lighter and a can of hairspray are Edward's best bets to knock them out.Fire plays an important role in the game at all times. If not extinguished, it will slowly burn through anything in the vicinity and spread until everything burnable has been reduced to a smoking pile of ash. This behavior can of course be useful to Edward if he for instance wants to get through a closed wooden door and has nothing heavy at hand to force his way.</plot>					<genre>ActionHorror</genre>					<releasedate>06/23/2008</releasedate>					<videoid>9lWaQe8LPW0</videoid>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/75-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/75-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/75-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/75-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/75-5.jpg</fanart5>					<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/75-6.jpg</fanart6>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/75-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/8/1/71281_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/75-1.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/e/2/gfs_74676_2_1_mid.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/2/7/gfs_74676_2_2_mid.jpg</snapshot2>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/75-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Alone in the Dark 2 (1993)">					<description>Alone in the Dark 2 (1993)</description>					<rom name="Alone in the Dark 2 (1993).zip" size="414092250"/>							<plot>You are the elusive detective of the macabre, Edward Carnby.

Batman investigates and comes to learn that the Joker is trying to create an army of Bane-like creatures to threaten Gotham City, and is forced to put a stop to the Joker's plans.

It's a sequel to Atlantis: The Lost Tales. However, unlike its precursor, not much of the game is based around Atlantis. It was followed by Atlantis III: The New World.In this adventure game, take Ten, the Bearer of Light, through his journey to Shambhala to confront the Bearer of Dark so that balance can be returned to the Universe. To find Shambhala, he must gather the pieces that make up the &quot;road to Shambhala&quot; from different locations and time periods - China, Ireland and the Yucatn.You begin aboard a ship in the mountains of Tibet, which acts as a home base. As the pieces are found and put in place, Ten is mystically transported to exotic locations and will become different characters. Each &quot;chapter&quot; can be played in any order since each is self-contained with its own puzzles, objects and people. Although each chapter is autonomous the final reward of each one is another piece of &quot;the road to Shamballa&quot;.Yucatn The character in the Yucatn chapter is Tepec, a loyal follower of a local city's king. Tepec's kingdom is in trouble because its protector-god, Quetzalcoatl (the Feathered Serpent), has fallen asleep and as a result great misfortunes happen to the kingdom; the corn crop is dying and a rival king makes a campaign to conquer Tepec's kingdom. So Tepec is assigned with the mission to go to the land of the dead, Xibalba, and awaken Quetzalcoatl to receive chulel, the divine blood which has life giving powers.Ireland Ten is transformed into Felim, a monk living in an Irish monastery in the early centuries of Christianity. He discovers a living remain of an ancient Irish king and then begins interacting with a set of characters from an old myth which is written in a book in the monastery library. His final goal is to help the characters get to the end of the story.China In this chapter Ten is in the body of a travelling Chinese civil servant who is stuck in a monastery because a ghost-shadow is blocking the entrance. As water supplies are running short, he decides to use the help of the Master of Directions to travel to a Chinese version of the land of the dead to consult an immortal excorcism master.Shamballa Shamballa is a fantasy place, which acts as a final screen of protection between the home base and the Dark's prison. Queen Rhea, a character from the prequel of the series is waiting there to link the story between the two games and guide Ten to the final level of the game, which is no other than the sunk Atlantis.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>12/07/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>VyL-cVva62E</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18901-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Avon (1989)">					<description>Avon (1989)</description>					<rom name="Avon (1989).zip" size="74492"/>					</game>			<game name="Azrael's Tear (1996)">					<description>Azrael's Tear (1996)</description>					<rom name="Azrael's Tear (1996).zip" size="433627864"/>							<plot>Azrael's Tear is an Action Adventure game, developed by Intelligent Games, Ltd. and published by Mindscape Inc.,  which was released in 1996.</plot>					<genre>Action Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/7/0/1670_front.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="BAT (1990)">					<description>BAT (1990)</description>					<rom name="BAT (1990).zip" size="689988"/>							<plot>B.A.T. is an Adventure game, developed by Computer's Dream and published by Ubisoft,  which was released in Europe in 1990.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1990</releasedate>					<videoid>MpQhiYzGVdo</videoid>			</game>			<game name="BAT 2 - The Koshan Conspiracy (1992)">					<description>BAT 2 - The Koshan Conspiracy (1992)</description>					<rom name="BAT 2 - The Koshan Conspiracy (1992).zip" size="8221184"/>							<plot>Part two of the BAT saga takes place in ROMA 2, the capital city of SHEDISHAN, a planet in the B8 system.

One day Taran notices that one of his pigs, Hen Wen has magical powers. The Evil Horned King wants the pig so that he can locate the Black Cauldron and ultimately rule the world. Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before his can discover the Cauldron's location.The Black Cauldron is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as Space Quest II or King's Quest III) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.[CR] - CHEATS - [CR][CR]Debug Mode[CR]During play, press Alt and D and the version number will be displayed, your X/Y coordinates on the current screen will be shown, a command line will appear at the bottom of the screen, and several debug commands will be unlocked.

The stated goal of the project is to recreate Valve's critically acclaimed 1998 video game Half-Life using the more advanced capabilities of the Source engine. The 40-person volunteer development team says they hope to create a more engrossing in-game world with more varied, complex environments and more challenging, realistic gameplay.During its eight years in development, Black Mesa has been featured in several video game publications and received direct attention from Valve. Due to its long development time the modification became notable for its delays, and dwindling updates on the status of its completion. The delays led to Wired awarding Black Mesa high spots on their &quot;Vaporware Of The Year&quot; lists in 2009 and 2010.The first part of Black Mesa, featuring remakes of all Half-Life's chapters except those set on the alien world &quot;Xen&quot;, was released as a standalone download on September 14, 2012.

You play as Aldo, a red-shirt-and-overalls-wearing adventurer who has to climb around a construction site and dodge barrels as he makes his way to a treasure chest at the end. Lest anyone mistake him for Mario, Aldo has a mullet.The run-and-jump gameplay is nearly indistinguishable from Donkey Kong, save for the addition of pickups like diamonds and vases. Later levels mix up the level design with non-linear levels or platforming sections with lava pits. Sometimes there will be one treasure chest, other times multiple goals. Levels get progressively more precarious and decidedly un-skyscraper-like. Its creative but quite inconsistent, as are the barely appropriate stage names like Ghost Town that hover randomly somewhere on the screen.(Review snippet courtesy of The Obscuritory, http://obscuritory.com.

This includes interaction withthe background, as well as the different characters. The player is not stuckon a single path through the game, and the choices you make truly affect theenviroment and the outcome of the game.In tone, we have striven to produce a realistic, yet slightly cartoonishenviroment. We hope this enhances the player's enjoyment of the game, andintensifies the story's interesting mix of humour and drama.Little Big Adventure is a strange and mysterious journey through a surrealand dangerous world. You take the role of Twinsen, a young Quetch entreatedin a dream by the Goddess Sendell to come to your planet's rescue. It is yourdestiny to restore peace and harmony to your world. You begin your questimprisoned in an asylum. From the start it is difficult to know whom to trustor where to go. The tyrant Dr. Funfrock has taken over your home planet ofTwinsun and has imposed his brutal methods of control over the entirepopulation. His primary weapons are his ability to clone different speciesand teleport these clones anywhere on the planet. There are four main specieson the planet: Quetches (Twinsen is a member of this pony-tailed group),Grobos (they look like elephants), Spheros (round little guys) andRabibunnies.All species suffer under his reign of terror, but few are capable ofresistance. You must find those who can help you, travelling great distancesin your quest to save the world and stop the evil Dr. Funfrock. At any momentyour enemies may overtake you, stopping you in your pursuit of the quest. Bewary and you will find a glorious tribute awaits your success.[CR] - CHEATS - [CR]Misc.

Can you complete the five ordeals, save Sci Fi and destroy the fiendish Protozorq plot, in time?Chamber of the Sci-Mutant Priestess (originally entitled Kult: The Temple of Flying Saucers) is a puzzle-solving adventure game. To solve the puzzles, Raven will sometimes need to collect and trade items; but more often, usage of the eight &quot;psi-powers&quot; is required. These powers range from a simple light spell (&quot;Solar Eyes&quot;) to instant-kill (&quot;EV&quot; - extreme violence) and complex psychological effects (&quot;Brainwarp&quot;). The five ordeals can be completed in any order, or even skipped altogether to reach a different ending. A time limit is imposed on the ordeals, and is calculated by turns. A &quot;wait&quot; command, which skips a turn, is also available.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1989</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>9PJhEDBHCLI</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21365-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/9/9/55799_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/21365-1.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="Chesterland Adventure (1995)">					<description>Chesterland Adventure (1995)</description>					<rom name="Chesterland Adventure (1995).zip" size="25613"/>							<plot>Blind Adventure is an Action game, developed and published by aiiekecute,  which was released in 2014.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>09/03/1981</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>ZqTr090xsWw</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17845-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Chewy - ESC from F5 (1997)">					<description>Chewy - ESC from F5 (1997)</description>					<rom name="Chewy - ESC from F5 (1997).zip" size="275566828"/>							<plot>Chewy: Esc from F5 is an Adventure game, developed by New Generation Software and published by Blue Byte,  which was released in Europe in 1995.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<videoid>v99YbY1mhGc</videoid>					<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/8/2/69882_front.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Child Murderer, The (1996)">					<description>Child Murderer, The (1996)</description>					<rom name="Child Murderer, The (1996).zip" size="769193"/>							<plot>The kingdom of Lemuria is in despair The Black Queen has stolen the Sun, the Moon and the Stars.

The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command &quot;Look&quot; may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>2015</releasedate>					<videoid>yG9TC-6nODs</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14722-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/14722.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Colony, The (1988)">					<description>Colony, The (1988)</description>					<rom name="Colony, The (1988).zip" size="255867"/>							<plot>Dark Colony is a real-time strategy with heavy emphasis on the actual combat.

CIA have received tips and clues about some suspicious activities of some known bad guys. Gather enough evidence through house search, wiretaps, etc. Decode any messages you discover to unravel additional clues. Each operation will be handled by multiple people. Figure out the crime before it happens and get enough evidence to find the true mastermind behind the whole thing. Then chase down and arrest the suspects via car chases or go into the house arrest the suspect yourself. Can you arrest all the masterminds? Covert Action is best described as a secret agent simulator, with a heavy dose of puzzle and some top-down shooter action. You'll follow the hints all over the world, surveil suspect safehouses, apply wiretaps (which is a puzzle sequence), even go inside and check each and every drawer without arousing suspicion (by keeping very quiet). If you're discovered, you'll need to avoid car chases or you'll end up shooting it out with the bad guys. You can also &quot;tail&quot; a suspect (with multiple cars) and see if you can find another safehouse or more headquarters to search for clues. You have a silenced pistol (or Uzi) and three different types of grenades, plus other high-tech toys. As you get closer to the mastermind, the plot gets more intricate, timeline gets shorter, code breaking is tougher, and enemies harder to take out.--MobyGames</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>06/03/1990</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19084-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/19084-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19084-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19084-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19084-3.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Crack of Doom, The (1989)">					<description>Crack of Doom, The (1989)</description>					<rom name="Crack of Doom, The (1989).zip" size="98804"/>							<plot>In Doom, a nameless space marine, gets punitively posted to Mars after assaulting a commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire upon civilians.

Each race brings something new as you try winning the race by using any of the strategies or switch between them during the race. The key factor in the game is the SCORE. You collect score while racing. Every stunt that you perform will award you with a certain number of score. Hitting objects, driving fast, drifting they all give you a certain number of score. When you reach 1000 you can burn away your score as nitro thus getting an edge over the others. If you are in the lead you can hit more objects thus gather more score. However hitting objects may cause you to make a mistake and crash into something that is immovable. If you can be patient and gather more than 2000 score, your nitro will be even stronger. Another tactic is to select one of the super cars which are fast and have a good traction. In this case you won't gather that much score but most probably you won't need it because you don't need nitro to stay ahead. Another way to win is to gather your score and never burn it since at the end all score points are converted to time and is subtracted from your overall time and you may jump ahead the winner.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<releasedate>12/31/1994</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19887-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19887-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19887-2.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Dragon Lore II - The Heart of the Dragon Man (1996)">					<description>Dragon Lore II - The Heart of the Dragon Man (1996)</description>					<rom name="Dragon Lore II - The Heart of the Dragon Man (1996).zip" size="2021394641"/>							<plot>The game is played from a first-person perspective with the direction in which the player is facing controlled by the mouse.

From the inventory, the player can also access objectives, review dialogue and examine any documents they have acquired.[9]To speak to people or interact with objects, the player must click on them with the pointer. As the player moves the pointer around the screen it can change to an arrow (meaning the player can move in that direction), a magnifying glass (meaning the player can inspect something in more detail), a cog with a red line through it (meaning the player must use an item on the object), a cog without a red line (meaning the player can operate the object without using an item) or a hand (meaning the player can pick the item up). When the player clicks on a person to whom they wish to speak, a list of conversation topics appear on screen. When the player picks up an item, it is automatically put into an auto-holder rather than the main inventory, and must be transferred manually from the auto-holder to the inventory screen. This allows the player to sort the inventory in any way they wish.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<videoid>DKdBs7Pc1JE</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20988-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/20988-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/20988-2.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Dragonsphere (1994)">					<description>Dragonsphere (1994)</description>					<rom name="Dragonsphere (1994).zip" size="136846893"/>							<plot>The young Callash has been just crowned the king of Gran Callahach. Twenty years ago the land was in grave peril, as the evil sorcerer Sanwe planned to conquer and ruin it. But he old king's court wizard Ner-Tom magically imprisoned Sanwe using the powers of the Dragonsphere spell. The sorcerer swore to avenge his humiliation once the spell's energy runs out.

As he approaches the sorcerer's prison, he is yet to realize that dealing with Sanwe will lead to startling realizations concerning his own self, and unravel a new sinister plot...Dragonsphere is a graphic adventure in the classic third-person LucasArts and Sierra style, and the third adventure game by MicroProse, similar visually and gameplay-wise to Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender. The interaction with the game world is performed by applying one of the ten different verb commands to objects and/or people. The game has vast amounts of unique text responses to player's actions and branching dialogue with characters. The puzzles are, for the most part, inventory-based. The game features hand-painted backgrounds and some digitized animation.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<videoid>Ihyeib17nqU</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14127-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/14127-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/1/9/gfs_45706_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/4/gfs_45706_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/5/4/gfs_45706_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/e/4/gfs_45706_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/f/4/gfs_45706_2_4.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Dragonworld (1984)">					<description>Dragonworld (1984)</description>					<rom name="Dragonworld (1984).zip" size="300652"/>							<plot>Dragonworld is an Adventure game, developed by Byron Preiss Multimedia and published by Trillium,  which was released in 1984.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1984</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/9/4/295894_front.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Drascula - The Vampire Strikes Back (1996)">					<description>Drascula - The Vampire Strikes Back (1996)</description>					<rom name="Drascula - The Vampire Strikes Back (1996).zip" size="69524834"/>							<plot>Upon hearing of his downgrade to a &quot;Dwarf Planet&quot; the humiliated former planet goes on a rampage.

Keep in mind that now you're over encumbered to an unknown amount and you would have to repeat the process if you wanted to carry any more items, so it's better to find a good place to unload all your extra items and where you'll have easier access to them when you need them, like the corridors on the main studio.[CR]</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>1991</releasedate>					<videoid>D0mK_T9dZ-U</videoid>			</game>			<game name="Emmanuelle (1989)">					<description>Emmanuelle (1989)</description>					<rom name="Emmanuelle (1989).zip" size="301808"/>							<plot>If you dream of winning in style at the Casino, if you are prepared to face rivals and smugglers, if you want to experience something out of the ordinary, and if you're not afraid of charm or sensuality...

However, Princess Lorealle the Worthy mysteriously disappears, abducted by her stepmother Morgana, who intends to put her own daughter on the throne. In order to prevent the princess from being rescued by a valiant knight, Morgana makes sure that the Union Hall selects the most unworthy one for this valiant task: Eric the Unready, known for bringing the book &quot;How to Joust&quot; to his duels.Eric the Unready is a humorous text adventure with graphics, similar in concept to Legend's own Spellcasting series. Like in those games, the player can select combinations of verbs and objects from a list to interact with the environment, but is encouraged and sometimes required to type commands as well. Some scenes display full-screen character portraits with pre-set dialogue choices. The game often makes verbose humorous comments on the player's actions, including many completely optional and arbitrary ones. It contains many segments that parody various aspects of contemporary pop culture as well as other video games.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>06/01/1993</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>WVsdnd3VAck</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23832-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/9/3/25193_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/9/4/25194_front.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/23832-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/23832-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/8/b/gfs_29684_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/4/e/gfs_29684_1_2_mid.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/0/d/gfs_29684_1_3_mid.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/c/4/gfs_29684_1_4_mid.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/8/7/gfs_29684_1_5_mid.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/4/2/gfs_29684_1_6_mid.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/a/gfs_29684_2_1_mid.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/4/f/gfs_29684_2_2_mid.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Escape from Delirium (1996)">					<description>Escape from Delirium (1996)</description>					<rom name="Escape from Delirium (1996).zip" size="9658424"/>							<plot>The game begins with Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley returning to Mle Island from their honeymoon, which they embarked on in the epilogue of The Curse of Monkey Island.

Two countries respectively ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have been competing over the right to explore the labyrinth. However, strange events started happening one after the other: the guardian of the labyrinth died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd apparently fell under some sort of a curse. A goblin reporter named Blount get caught in the midst of these events as he attempts to interview the queen and the king. As if that weren't enough, Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf and falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.Goblins Quest is the third entry in the Gobliiins series. Like its predecessors, it is a puzzle adventure game with the emphasis on solving complex tasks confined to smaller areas rather than on exploration. Most levels occupy more than one screen and allow limited navigation between different areas. As the reduction of the title to a single &quot;i&quot; implies, this installment only features one controllable goblin. However, at various points of the game Blount will require assistance from other player-controlled characters such as Chump the parrot, Ooya the magician, and Fulbert the snake. In addition, Blount's own spontaneous transformation into a werewolf may affect the solution of some puzzles. The hero will also undergo a few other mutations and drastically change his size during the course of the game.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1983</releasedate>					<videoid>vnV5ZZii1gI</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14719-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/1/1/82211_front.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/14719.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Fourth Protocol, The (1985)">					<description>Fourth Protocol, The (1985)</description>					<rom name="Fourth Protocol, The (1985).zip" size="91094"/>							<plot>Alpha Protocol is a hybrid of role-playing game and shooter, bearing certain similarities to Deus Ex.

However in one particular gunfight with an outlaw named Kenny he was outgunned and Freddy had his ear shot off. This traumatic experience caused Freddy to give up his pistols and enroll in the school of pharmacology. Blocking out the memories of his past, Freddy arrives in the town of Coarsegold with the dream to own and run his own pharmacy. Working with the town's doctor, Freddy is able to fill prescriptions, mix concoctions and diagnose simple symptoms. Business among the townsfolk is brisk however, the good times are not to last as suddenly townsfolk are run out of town and businesses are being foreclosed and boarded up. Freddy must deal with the town's problems, and discover the larger plot, or risk having a fancy shop in an empty town and losing all his customers.Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist is a humorous point-and-click adventure game bearing many similarities to other Sierra titles in the same genre, in particular Leisure Suit Larry series. Players use the command bar at the top of the screen to choose a verb command that is combined with locations and objects visible to the player. Freddy can walk to new locations, look at particular objects, attempt to use objects, talk to people and enter his inventory to access items that have been picked up. Like other Sierra games, successful actions add to the player's score, judging the player on 1000 points.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1993</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>ow33gh2Otco</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9446-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/7/5/24875_front.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9446.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Free DC (1991)">					<description>Free DC (1991)</description>					<rom name="Free DC (1991).zip" size="2601786"/>							<plot>SkiFree is a computer game created by Chris Pirih, who was working as a programmer at Microsoft at the time.

The Kushan discovered the wreckage of the Khar-Toba, an interstellar transport, in a desert on Kharak, and inside found a galactic map etched on a piece of stone. From this the Kushan concluded they had been transplanted to Kharak some time ago. To reclaim their home planet&quot;Hiigara&quot; the Kushan built an enormous self-sufficient Mothership to carry 600,000 people on a crusade to reclaim Hiigara. This led to the engagement and eventual defeat of the Taiidan Empire which exiled them.The story continues that some time later, the Khar-Toba was found to contain one of the Three Hyperspace Cores, left behind by a so-called Progenitor race, which eventually allowed hyperspace travel. The First Core was possessed by the Bentusi: a powerful and enigmatic race of traders who assisted the Exiles (the campaign can be played using Kushan or Taiidan craft in the original game) during the first game. The third was lost until approximately one hundred years after the Exiles reclaimed Hiigara, found by a Vaygr Warlord named Makaan, who used it to conquer much of the galaxy andas of the beginning of Homeworld 2began attempts to capture Hiigara. The story states that religious beings of the galaxy consider the discovery of the Third Core to announce the End Times, during which Sajuuk, thought to be an immensely powerful being, will return.The game begins with the commissioning of a new Mothership, the Pride of Hiigara, similar in shape and design to the original Mothership and commanded by Karan S'jet, as in the original game. The ship is attacked by the Vaygr during the final stages of construction but escapes. The Bentusi inform the Hiigarans that they must find Balcora Gate, left behind by the Progenitors, behind which is something essential for stopping either the Vaygr threat, the End Times, or both. Makaan learns of and reaches the location as well, and the game's penultimate mission takes place on the other side of Balcora Gate, where Hiigarans and Vaygr alike discover an enormous Progenitor starship, named Sajuuk, with sockets for the Three Hyperspace Cores. After defeating Makaan the Hiigarans combine the Vaygr, Hiigaran and Bentusi Cores (recovered from the wreckage of the last of the Bentusi ships) within Sajuuk, and use it to defeat the leaderless-but-still-dangerous Vaygr invasion; Sajuuk is later found to be the key to a galaxy-wide network of hyperspace gates, ushering in a new age of trade and prosperity for all civilized races in the galaxy.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>09/16/2003</releasedate>					<videoid>A3W-r9IobwI</videoid>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/765-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/765-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/0/0/25200_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/765-1.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="Geisha (1990)">					<description>Geisha (1990)</description>					<rom name="Geisha (1990).zip" size="779505"/>							<plot>Geisha is an Adventure game, developed by Coktel Vision and published by Tomahawk,  which was released in Europe in 1990.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1990</releasedate>			</game>			<game name="Gene Machine, The (1996)">					<description>Gene Machine, The (1996)</description>					<rom name="Gene Machine, The (1996).zip" size="377208475"/>							<plot>The story begins in the 1880s in London.

There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality - its own strengths and weaknesses. As the game develops the characters themselves will develop and grow. What's more, each one has its own unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood whilst others can cut the lights in the room...Each time you scare a human or 'mortal', you will increase your plasm; the energy you need to scare them in the first place. Scare them too much and people will flee from the building, hence making your job more difficult.Ghost Master has a true state-of-the-art AI engine which means the player gets a sense of natural human behaviour. The mortals will go about their every day lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with others... until they encounter the horrors you control! After these encounters they will become irrational, afraid and sometimes even go insane!

Two countries respectively ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have been competing over the right to explore the labyrinth. However, strange events started happening one after the other: the guardian of the labyrinth died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd apparently fell under some sort of a curse. A goblin reporter named Blount get caught in the midst of these events as he attempts to interview the queen and the king. As if that weren't enough, Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf and falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.Goblins Quest is the third entry in the Gobliiins series. Like its predecessors, it is a puzzle adventure game with the emphasis on solving complex tasks confined to smaller areas rather than on exploration. Most levels occupy more than one screen and allow limited navigation between different areas. As the reduction of the title to a single &quot;i&quot; implies, this installment only features one controllable goblin. However, at various points of the game Blount will require assistance from other player-controlled characters such as Chump the parrot, Ooya the magician, and Fulbert the snake. In addition, Blount's own spontaneous transformation into a werewolf may affect the solution of some puzzles. The hero will also undergo a few other mutations and drastically change his size during the course of the game.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>1993</releasedate>					<videoid>26F2zE0YM1w</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14719-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/14719.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Gold Rush!

Each route has it's dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink..

Your mission is to infiltrate an island occupied by the D.V.S. and retrieve the first part of the blueprints.Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform game, where your objective is to complete 15 levels, allowing you to gain access to the &quot;main fortress&quot; which is the 16th level. On each level, you have to find and destroy a radar dish, and also find a bundle of dynamite and place it at the exit to blow it open.On your way, you'll be threatened by human henchmen and robots, as well as various hazards, such as spikes, deadly laser beams (which have to be de-activated by finding a floppy disk and bringing it to a computer terminal) or pools of acid. The only weapon you have is a rifle which can be used to kill most opponents, though some are immune to bullets or require a little more than shooting blindly if you want to kill them! Agent 006 has three health points, and losing all three will kill him (though you have unlimited lives) - not to mention that some hazards kill instantly! You'll also have to make good use of pushable barrels which you can occasionally find: they'll be used as stepping-stones to reach higher ground, but make sure you don't drop them into a pit from which they cannot be retrieved.There's a variety of objects to collect - ammunition, bonus objects that give score (such as bags of money, briefcases, walkie-talkies etc.), and an opportunity to get a big score bonus: on each level, if you find three letters S, P, Y and collect them in the exactly right order, you'll get a lot of points - but it won't be easy! You can also find a few power-ups: boots that speed you up for a while, goggles that makes a few more platforms appear (thus giving you access to unreachable spots), an &quot;increased shot power&quot; item which allows you to fire faster, but also a question mark which reverses your movement for a moment (very confusing) or a &quot;1/2&quot; fraction which slows you down.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>02/01/1992</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>PvXDik3-XG0</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19258-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Hezarin (1981)">					<description>Hezarin (1981)</description>					<rom name="Hezarin (1981).zip" size="170240"/>							<plot>Hezarin is an Adventure game, developed and published by Topologika,  which was released in Europe in 1990.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1990</releasedate>			</game>			<game name="High Stakes by Dick Francis (1986)">					<description>High Stakes by Dick Francis (1986)</description>					<rom name="High Stakes by Dick Francis (1986).zip" size="102385"/>							<plot>Just like its predecessors Need for Speed: High Stakes is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.It is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.In addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>06/16/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<videoid>3LydQnciWqI</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20362-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/8/3/295683_front.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Hippy's Quest (1990)">					<description>Hippy's Quest (1990)</description>					<rom name="Hippy's Quest (1990).zip" size="86420"/>							<plot>Welcome back the past with City Quest, a powerful love letter to the adventure games of yesteryear.

Most of the screen is used for a visual rendition of the current scene. At the bottom of the screen are words, which can be clicked on using the mouse to activate their functions. For example, objects can be picked up, used, pushed or pulled, and turned on and off. Most locations are from the movie, but some further scenes are added.In keeping with Indiana's action-man persona, the game also features pure action scenes. Unlike most Lucasfilm adventures, you can die.Two PC versions of the game were released, one with 16 color EGA graphics, and one with 256 color VGA graphics.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>07/02/1989</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6567-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6567-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/1/9/25519_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6567-1.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/6567-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/6/b/gfs_45827_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/6/a/gfs_45827_2_1_mid.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/6567-g.png</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/6567.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992)">					<description>Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992)</description>					<rom name="Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992).zip" size="61655657"/>							<plot>Fate of Atlantis has the player explore environments and interact with objects and characters by using commands constructed with predetermined verbs.

Set in a post-ice-age world in the distant future,  the game focuses on survival and exploration.  A 2D sidescroller without a linear path. An action game with tactical combat and strategic planning. An adventure game that lets you free-roam a vast, procedurally-generated world. A Valley Without Wind defies genre stereotypes. Unlike other procedurally-generated games, you also get a logical progression in difficulty, plus helpful tips and checklists to guide your travels (should you need them).  Choose for yourself how to prepare to face the vastly stronger Overlord. Complete a variety of missions to earn arcane rewards, or roam the wilds to uncover secret missions and stashes of magical loot. Customize your characters with unique combinations of enchants and spells that change how you move, jump, and fight. Or rescue people and bring them back to your settlement, recruiting them to help you in return.  You choose how to play, and the world adapts around you.  Key features: - Travel alone or with friends across an ever-expanding world of dangerous creatures, powerful magic, high technology, and mysteries. - You have choice. The world of Environ is procedurally generated, and lets you go anywhere you see -- including right into the overlord's keep at any time. (Good luck with that.) - Environ is endless. When you save one continent from an overlord, a larger and more complex continent appears. - The game adapts to how you play: as you demonstrate your proficiency, monsters upgrade accordingly. Killed 100 bats? Okay, time for... bats on fire! - Crazy amounts of character customization. Combine a multitude of spells, enchants, and equipment to create specialized character builds. - Play as a long line of brave adventurers. It's not a question of IF your character is going to die, but WHEN. Any character that dies is permanently lost, but you keep all your inventory, enchants, and general progress in the game. - Become a community leader. Rescue NPCs, have them join your settlement, and construct buildings for them -- they may return the favor and help you. - Be a clever problem-solver. Challenges have more than one solution, each with its own pros and cons. You get to figure things out rather than just jumping through a set of hoops. - Difficulty levels give exactly the challenge you want, from casual to hardcore on both platforming and combat independently. - New updates are arriving all the time packed with additional content, improvements, and more.</plot>					<genre>Construction and Management SimulationLife SimulationSandbox</genre>					<releasedate>03/30/2010</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>1HTbTmmEBtI</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10887-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/10887-g.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Kingdom of Hamil (1987)">					<description>Kingdom of Hamil (1987)</description>					<rom name="Kingdom of Hamil (1987).zip" size="56657"/>							<plot>Build your own Medieval world in A Kingdom for Keflings, a city-building game from NinjaBee.Play as a giant to help the tiny Keflings build up and beautify their Kingdom.

You can play by yourself, or compete with other human players or the computer-controlled Jones. At the beginning of the game you determine what your goals are, in four categories - Money, Happiness, Education and Career: the higher your goals, the longer the game. The game itself is presented as something akin to a board game. The board represents the city where you live. Each turn (here, a turn represents a week of your life) you have limited time to act, and you have to choose how to spend it. Walking somewhere else costs you time, as well as working, learning, and looking for a job. The first thing you should do is looking for a job at an employment center. Since initially you have no education, experience or work history, you can only choose the simplest, lowest-paying jobs - such as a janitor or a cook. Later on, as you enroll into various courses at an university, you'll get smart enough to get the high-ranking jobs. But remember that some jobs require you to buy and wear expensive clothes. Work isn't mandatory, and you can dedicate time to working whenever you feel like it. The money you get can be spent in many ways. You can buy a snack at a fast food restaurant (you should eat something each week, or next week you'll have less time due to hunger). You can buy some appliances for your house, lottery tickets, newspapers and more. You can also store your money in the bank (a wise choice, considering the ubiquity of pickpockets) or invest into stock market. Remember that you have to pay rent for your house - if you don't pay for a long time, your landlord will garnish some amount from the money you earn at work. But if you get enough cash, you can rent a luxury apartment and move out of the stinky hole inside which you've been spending your life earlier!</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<videoid>_eHZ-NCjyJM</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14254-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/14254.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Larry Vales - Traffic Division (2000)">					<description>Larry Vales - Traffic Division (2000)</description>					<rom name="Larry Vales - Traffic Division (2000).zip" size="1390672"/>							<plot>A devastating pandemic sweeps through New York City, and one by one, basic services fail.

This includes interaction withthe background, as well as the different characters. The player is not stuckon a single path through the game, and the choices you make truly affect theenviroment and the outcome of the game.In tone, we have striven to produce a realistic, yet slightly cartoonishenviroment. We hope this enhances the player's enjoyment of the game, andintensifies the story's interesting mix of humour and drama.Little Big Adventure is a strange and mysterious journey through a surrealand dangerous world. You take the role of Twinsen, a young Quetch entreatedin a dream by the Goddess Sendell to come to your planet's rescue. It is yourdestiny to restore peace and harmony to your world. You begin your questimprisoned in an asylum. From the start it is difficult to know whom to trustor where to go. The tyrant Dr. Funfrock has taken over your home planet ofTwinsun and has imposed his brutal methods of control over the entirepopulation. His primary weapons are his ability to clone different speciesand teleport these clones anywhere on the planet. There are four main specieson the planet: Quetches (Twinsen is a member of this pony-tailed group),Grobos (they look like elephants), Spheros (round little guys) andRabibunnies.All species suffer under his reign of terror, but few are capable ofresistance. You must find those who can help you, travelling great distancesin your quest to save the world and stop the evil Dr. Funfrock. At any momentyour enemies may overtake you, stopping you in your pursuit of the quest. Bewary and you will find a glorious tribute awaits your success.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<releasedate>10/01/1994</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21880-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/7/3/71673_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/7/1/71671_front.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/21880-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/21880-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/21880-3.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Lone Eagle - Colombian Encounter (1994)">					<description>Lone Eagle - Colombian Encounter (1994)</description>					<rom name="Lone Eagle - Colombian Encounter (1994).zip" size="3443981"/>							<plot>From the creator of Soul Brother and Soundless Mountain II, comes an original and adult Psychological Horror.The masked protagonist must escape from a city ravaged by disease, by any means.

Each draft is a spell that has an effect of a certain type, such as &quot;Opening&quot; or &quot;Night Vision&quot;.

From here, the player gradually &quot;recruits&quot; various members of the Fellowship, and while the game can be completed by following the novel for the most part, many side-quests also exist to entertain the player. The game world was quite large and featured a cast of characters from both the text and outside of it; character interaction is carried out through &quot;questioning&quot; other characters by typing keywords in a box. The player can swap whoever leads the &quot;fellowship&quot;, equip other party members with a range of weapons and armour, distribute skills among the group, cast spells, and perform various skill-based actions. While following a somewhat linear plot, gameplay is quite open and players can revisit old areas and, potentially, discover new situations and characters, creating a fairly dynamic game world. The game also includes a day/night cycle, in which enemies such as the Nazgl make more frequent appearance outside of daylight hours, and other enemies receive strength bonuses in the dark.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>1994</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>ZhWFBZHTKYw</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19954-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19954-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19954-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19954-3.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Lords of Doom (1990)">					<description>Lords of Doom (1990)</description>					<rom name="Lords of Doom (1990).zip" size="10715242"/>							<plot>Lords of Doom is an Action game, developed by Attic Entertainment and published by Starbyte,  which was released in Europe in 1990.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1997</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14033-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Lost Crown of Queen Anne, The (1988)">					<description>Lost Crown of Queen Anne, The (1988)</description>					<rom name="Lost Crown of Queen Anne, The (1988).zip" size="158371"/>							<plot>Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas is an Adventure game, developed and published by Nitro+,  which was released in Japan in 2012.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>05/16/2012</releasedate>					<videoid>bs7Of2RBXto</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17434-1.png</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Lost Dutchman Mine, The (1989)">					<description>Lost Dutchman Mine, The (1989)</description>					<rom name="Lost Dutchman Mine, The (1989).zip" size="525197"/>							<plot>In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers.

Tech, you've heard stories about the creepy old campus basements and storage rooms, some so ancient that they contain only rotting piles of unidentifiable junk. Until now, you've never ventured lower than the ground floors of the monolithic classroom and dorm buildings, avoiding the warren of tunnels that connect them. But tonight, something draws you down into the mysterious depths of the institute. Perhaps it's the blizzard raging outside, making the outdoors as threatening as anything you could imagine within. Perhaps it's the nightmare you had, hinting at horrific mysteries below and leaving you with a strange object that seems to lead you inexorably downward. Or perhaps it's just another way for you to avoid writing that twenty page term paper you have due tomorrow. In any event, you soon find yourself wandering away from your computer and into the dark nether regions of G.U.E. Tech. Suddenly, you're in a world that rivals your most hideos visions, a realm of horror lurking beneath the calm corridors and study halls. Shapes emerge from dark corners. Eerie sounds draw closer. Slimy passageways lead to sights so horrifying that they will feed your nightmares for weeks. THE LURKING HORROR recalls the ghastly visions of H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, as author Dave Lebling turns an everyday world into a frightening web of uncertainty. The numerous puzzles will challenge both first-time and experienced players, and Lebling's chilling descriptions will leave you with images you'll never forget.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25291-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/1/7/24517_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/25291-1.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="MTV's Club Dead (1994)">					<description>MTV's Club Dead (1994)</description>					<rom name="MTV's Club Dead (1994).zip" size="412466168"/>							<plot>MTV's Club Dead is an Adventure game, developed and published by Viacom New Media,  which was released in 1994.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>02/19/2008</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8430-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/8430-1.jpg</snapshot1>			</game>			<game name="Mad Cow Man and Deep Fried Beef Fat Boy (1997)">					<description>Mad Cow Man and Deep Fried Beef Fat Boy (1997)</description>					<rom name="Mad Cow Man and Deep Fried Beef Fat Boy (1997).zip" size="69394"/>							<plot>Seeking to take advantage of a weakened Earth, X-COM's deep space foes unexpectedly change strategy and launch a powerful second front against planet Earth.In the dark depths of vast oceans, long sleeping forces are awakened by reanimation signals sent out across the galactic silence by their interstellar brothers and sisters.

Left with no alternatives, the player assumes the identity of a local Manhunter and solves more crimes for the alien Orbs while searching for Phil and working for the local human resistance.Manhunter 2 presents the same urban decay and oppressive alien invader regime as visualized in the original, this time using streets and landmarks from the Bay Area. The Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, Alcatraz prison, and the TransAmerica Pyramid all receive alien makeovers. New puzzles, new characters, and new investigations await as the player tracks Phil by his string of strangled corpses.All concepts and gameplay elements from Manhunter: New York return. The player again uses the MAD tracking device to follow suspects provided by the alien Orbs and uses clues found through first-person location investigation to discover the suspects' name. Occasional arcade sequences bring mixed challenges, and though they cannot be skipped, a new difficulty option has been implemented. The same point-and-click gameplay (no typing required) is used to navigate the game world.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1989</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14885-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/8/8/25988_front.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/14885.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Maniac Mansion (1987)">					<description>Maniac Mansion (1987)</description>					<rom name="Maniac Mansion (1987).zip" size="210430"/>							<plot>Maniac Mansion is a 1987 graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games.

This version was made by Ubisoft's studio in Sofia, Bulgaria. The PlayStation 2 version is not the same as the Microsoft Windows version. The player has free movement and control of the view, which was required by Sony America. This change created extraordinary difficulties for the developer.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>03/14/2013</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>wDTNw-Ajp9c</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17955-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/0/5/8/300058_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/17955-1.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/4/5/gfs_340544_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/9/5/gfs_340544_1_2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/d/8/gfs_340544_2_1.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/0/8/gfs_340544_2_2.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/b/8/gfs_340544_2_3.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/a/8/gfs_340544_2_4.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Murders in Space (1990)">					<description>Murders in Space (1990)</description>					<rom name="Murders in Space (1990).zip" size="546926"/>							<plot>Players suit up as an Operative of the Ark Corporation (ArkCo), deployed into the deepest, darkest, and most dangerous part of the universe.

Carey finds his best friend and ex-partner, Officer Bob Hickman, murdered in an alley in the Southern part of the city. An eight-year-old boy named Bobby Washington has been murdered as well. Carey begins an investigation that leads him deep into the criminal life of the city and a hunt for a maniacal murderer.The game utilizes Sierra's traditional icon-based interface for interaction with the environment and generally follows an adventure format. However, it focuses on realistic police procedures even more than the previous games in the series. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to examining crime scenes, questioning suspects, and conducting a by-the-book investigation. There is a considerable degree of freedom in the interaction, allowing the player to perform actions not connected to the main story, some of which will, however, lead to the protagonist's death.

Before he is given a chance to investigate further, a large warship decloaks behind him, and fires. His ship is badly damaged and careens towards the planetary mass. He crash-lands on a strange planet, seemingly inhabited by women only. He sets off in search of the vase and a way to get off the planet.Decades ago, a vicious war between the sexes erupted on the planet. The males focused on developing mechanical and electronic weaponry, while the females focused on biological warfare. In the end, the females unleashed a biological weapon that eliminated the male population. Due to side effects caused by the biological weapon, the females were no longer able to give birth to males, so they had no way of continuing their species. So they invented a machine that would allow them to alter their sex for short periods of time. This machine became known as the Cosmic Gender Bender, or the Gender Bender for short.The populace of the planet is divided into two classes, Keepers and (breeding) Stock. The Keepers are technologically advanced and reside underground, where they monitor the Stock. The Stock reside above ground and have a primitive culture. Their only purpose is to be impregnated by a gender bent Keeper in order to repopulate the planet.[CR] - CHEATS - [CR]Misc.

The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale. However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.[CR] - CHEATS - [CR]Skip the Sikkim Temple Maze[CR]In the first room of the temple hold the &amp;lt;ctrl&amp;gt; key and type in &lt;b&gt;lee&lt;/b&gt;.[CR]</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1987</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21367-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/3/2/8132_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/21367-1.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="Ringworld - Revenge of the Patriarch (1992)">					<description>Ringworld - Revenge of the Patriarch (1992)</description>					<rom name="Ringworld - Revenge of the Patriarch (1992).zip" size="272083016"/>							<plot>Eons ago, you battered DOH into an intergalactic pulp and escaped.

He seeks out the Pirate Leaders, who set him three challenges to prove himself a pirate: defeat Carla, the island's swordmaster in insult swordfighting, steal a statue from the Governor's mansion, and find buried treasure.Along the way he meets several interesting characters, including Stan the used boat salesman, Meathook (a fellow with hooks on both hands), a prisoner named Otis, the three men of low moral fiber and, most significantly, the gorgeous Governor Elaine Marley. The ghost pirate LeChuck, however, has been in love with Elaine since his living days. While Guybrush is busy, LeChuck's ghost crew abduct her, taking her to Monkey Island. Guybrush gathers a crew (Carla, Meathook, and Otis), buys a boat, and sets out to find the mysterious island and free Elaine.When Guybrush finally reaches Monkey Island, he explores it and discovers a band of cannibals and a strange hermit named Herman Toothrot. After he helps the cannibals recover a lost voodoo ingredient (a magical root), they provide him with a seltzer bottle filled with &quot;voodoo root elixir&quot; that can destroy ghosts. However, when Guybrush goes after LeChuck, he is told that LeChuck went to Mle Island to marry Elaine.Guybrush returns to Mle and goes to the church to prevent the wedding. When he arrives at the church wedding, he realises that Elaine had her own plan to escape. Guybrush loses the elixir and LeChuck starts beating him, until they arrive at the ship emporium where he finds a bottle of root beer. Substituting root beer for the lost ghost-fighting elixir, he sprays LeChuck and the ghost pirate is destroyed. With LeChuck defeated, Guybrush and Elaine enjoy a romantic moment, watching fireworks.</plot>					<genre>AdventurePuzzle</genre>					<releasedate>01/31/1990</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>SZHBGVblNJA</videoid>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/144-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/144-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/144-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/144-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/144-5.jpg</fanart5>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/144-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/3/1/79131_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/144-1.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/144-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/3/0/gfs_78767_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/f/5/gfs_78767_1_2_mid.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/144-g.png</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/144.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Secret Mission (1996)">					<description>Secret Mission (1996)</description>					<rom name="Secret Mission (1996).zip" size="285150357"/>							<plot>As Agent 006, you are the world's only hope: the terrorist organization known as the D.V.S. has captured the blueprints to a new, powerful weapon known as the &quot;Red Rock Rover&quot;. Your mission is to infiltrate an island occupied by the D.V.S. and retrieve the first part of the blueprints.Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform game, where your objective is to complete 15 levels, allowing you to gain access to the &quot;main fortress&quot; which is the 16th level. On each level, you have to find and destroy a radar dish, and also find a bundle of dynamite and place it at the exit to blow it open.On your way, you'll be threatened by human henchmen and robots, as well as various hazards, such as spikes, deadly laser beams (which have to be de-activated by finding a floppy disk and bringing it to a computer terminal) or pools of acid. The only weapon you have is a rifle which can be used to kill most opponents, though some are immune to bullets or require a little more than shooting blindly if you want to kill them! Agent 006 has three health points, and losing all three will kill him (though you have unlimited lives) - not to mention that some hazards kill instantly! You'll also have to make good use of pushable barrels which you can occasionally find: they'll be used as stepping-stones to reach higher ground, but make sure you don't drop them into a pit from which they cannot be retrieved.There's a variety of objects to collect - ammunition, bonus objects that give score (such as bags of money, briefcases, walkie-talkies etc.), and an opportunity to get a big score bonus: on each level, if you find three letters S, P, Y and collect them in the exactly right order, you'll get a lot of points - but it won't be easy! You can also find a few power-ups: boots that speed you up for a while, goggles that makes a few more platforms appear (thus giving you access to unreachable spots), an &quot;increased shot power&quot; item which allows you to fire faster, but also a question mark which reverses your movement for a moment (very confusing) or a &quot;1/2&quot; fraction which slows you down.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>02/01/1992</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19258-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Secret of Monkey Island, The (1990)">					<description>Secret of Monkey Island, The (1990)</description>					<rom name="Secret of Monkey Island, The (1990).zip" size="222095522"/>							<plot>The game begins on the Caribbean island of Mle, where a youth named Guybrush Threepwood wants to be a pirate.

As one of the original titles in the popular MacVenture series that went on to be celebrated on the NES, GBC, and Nintendo 64, Shadowgate quickly endeared players with its fantastic atmospheric soundtrack, perilous locations to progress through, countless puzzles to solve, and more ways to gruesomely die than gamers previously thought possible. Thrust into the role of &quot;The Seed of Prophecy,&quot; players travel deep into the living castle, in hopes of defeating the evil that dwells within  the dreaded Warlock Lord.  Now, nearly 30 years after the original version haunted Mac and NES gamers, the original development team behind that timeless classic is back with a full re-imagining of the original Shadowgate. Much more than a port, the team at Zojoi has painstakingly redesigned the game from the ground up, adding in tons of new mind-bending puzzles, lots of new rooms with stunning hand-painted 2D graphical detail, and more objects to interact with and help you along your quest.  Decide how YOU want to play this new, re-imagined Shadowgate! Want the modern adventure experience? Use the wheel-based icon command system. Want the retro experience? Employ the Classic command system and turn on the retro graphics, soundtrack, text box, and room transitions. Want a more cinematic experience? Switch to Immersive mode by auto-hiding the UI and using customizable hotkeys to explore the castle. Or mix and match the options to satisfy your play style. In Shadowgate, there are plenty of new features and fun throwbacks to the original version to satisfy veteran adventurers and newcomers alike! Key Features:****************Customized UI: Play the way you want! Use modern wheel-based icon commands, classic on-screen commands, or jump into Immersive mode to auto-hide the UI elements.

For the ultimate challenge, try Ironman mode that disables saves and requires players to finish the game in one try. Retro Mode: Play the game like its 1989! Toggle on pixelated graphics, listen to Hiroyuki Masunos original NES chip tunes, move between rooms with NES transitions, and enjoy the text in retro format. Storytelling: Shadowgate features dramatic cut-scenes and all the same great storytelling you expect from the original creators. Cinematic Score: A digitally-orchestrated, dynamic soundtrack that changes with gameplay by composer Rich Douglas. Soundscapes: A complete atmospheric and puzzle-based sound design featuring hundreds of sound effects.Achievements: 60 in-game achievements to find and unlock.Animations: Environmental and object-specific animations and particles bring each location to life.Help: Need a hint?

Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Exploring an original story of vengeance and redemption, the game puts players in the role of Talion, a valiant ranger whose family is slain in front of him the night Sauron and his army return to Mordor -- moments before his own life is taken. Resurrected by a Spirit of vengeance and empowered with Wraith abilities, Talion ventures into Mordor and vows to destroy those who have wronged him. Through the course of his personal vendetta, Talion uncovers the truth of the Spirit that compels him, learns the origins of the Rings of Power and ultimately confronts his true nemesis.Every enemy that players face is a unique individual, differentiated by their personality, strengths and weaknesses. Through the Nemesis System, enemy relationships and characteristics are shaped by player actions and decisions to create personal archenemies that remember and adapt to the player and are distinct to every gameplay session. Gamers are able to craft their own battles, enemies and rewards within the dynamic world that remembers and adapts to their choices, delivering a unique experience to every player.</plot>					<genre>ActionRole-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>09/30/2014</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>X8hoTfZ3vUc</videoid>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/18857-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/18857-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/18857-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18857-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/3/5/27235_front.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/18857-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/18857-g.png</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/18857.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shannara (1995)">					<description>Shannara (1995)</description>					<rom name="Shannara (1995).zip" size="510210361"/>							<plot>Brona's evil spirit has come back to wreak revenge upon those who killed him.

His dog, &quot;Chippy&quot;, discovers a chest in the loft of his house containing a spellbook titled &quot;Ye Olde Spellbooke&quot; (which Simon derisively reads as &quot;Ye old-ee spellbook-ee&quot;). Simon throws the book onto the floor in contempt, but a portal opens above it. Chippy goes through the portal and Simon follows.After entering the portal, Simon finds himself in another world. After escaping from some goblins who intended to eat him, he discovers that he has been brought on a quest to rescue the wizard Calypso from the evil sorcerer Sordid.</plot>					<genre>AdventurePuzzle</genre>					<releasedate>01/02/1993</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>1PxWARwGG0Y</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12538-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/2/1/24921_front.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/12538-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/12538.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Simon the Sorcerer II - The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe (1995)">					<description>Simon the Sorcerer II - The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe (1995)</description>					<rom name="Simon the Sorcerer II - The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe (1995).zip" size="70047155"/>							<plot>????????????????????????????

Schulz's comic strip, Peanuts. The game is based on one of the most famous Snoopy alter egos: a World War I flying ace battling against Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, the Flying Circus: Jagdgeschwader 1, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and other enemies of the war.The game is introduced in a scene as Charlie Brown and Lucy van Pelt find Snoopy sleeping on top on his doghouse as usual and wondering what Snoopy might be dreaming about. Snoopy quickly wakes up shooting imaginary enemies. Charlie Brown replies that Snoopy is probably dreaming about being a famous World War I flying ace. The game then focuses on Snoopy's dream.The game ends with a similar cutscene where Snoopy is acting out flying on his doghouse while typing a story. When Linus asks Charlie Brown what his dog is doing, Charlie Brown replies that he is probably working on a sequel, thereby implying a sequel to the game. It was called Snoopy Flying Ace.Snoopy vs. the Red Baron is the first (and so far only) time the characters have been animated in 3D with the express permission and tacit approval of Creative Associates and the Schulz family for an officially licensed Peanuts product.An earlier game with a similar theme and name, Snoopy and the Red Baron, was released by Atari in 1983 for the Atari 2600 platform. Despite the similarities, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron is not a sequel to the earlier Snoopy and the Red Baron. Planned releases for Xbox and GameCube were cancelled, possibly due to low sales for Xbox and limited resources for GameCube.</plot>					<genre>Flight Simulator</genre>					<releasedate>10/24/2006</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20715-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/20715-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/20715-2.jpg</snapshot2>			</game>			<game name="Snow Queen, The (1993)">					<description>Snow Queen, The (1993)</description>					<rom name="Snow Queen, The (1993).zip" size="29260"/>							<plot>Snow Queen is an Adventure game, published by Midas Interactive Entertainment,  with no announced release date.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<releasedate>02/20/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<videoid>KKw2UT8Q1Kg</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/28886-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Softporn Adventure (1991)">					<description>Softporn Adventure (1991)</description>					<rom name="Softporn Adventure (1991).zip" size="55707"/>							<plot>Softporn Adventure is an Adventure game, published by Sierra Entertainment,  which was released in 1981.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>09/03/1981</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>ZqTr090xsWw</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17845-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/9/9/296299_front.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Soltys (1995)">					<description>Soltys (1995)</description>					<rom name="Soltys (1995).zip" size="3509239"/>							<plot>Soltys is an Adventure game, developed and published by LK Avalon,  which was released in Europe in 1995.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1995</releasedate>			</game>			<game name="Sorcerer (1984)">					<description>Sorcerer (1984)</description>					<rom name="Sorcerer (1984).zip" size="159742"/>							<plot>SORCERER, second of a spellbinding fantasy series in the tradition of Zork, takes you on a magical tour through the darker side of Zorkian enchantment.

He hopes to collect enough crystals to start a profitable twibble farm. Crystal Caves is a side-scrolling platform game, where the objective is to finish all 16 levels, collecting every single crystal within. On his way, Mylo is threatened by numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it's easy to get Mylo stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be restarted. Apart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot - collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but it's not always easy to get them! It's also possible to find a power-up that reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as they are always instrumental to victory!</plot>					<genre>ActionPlatform</genre>					<releasedate>10/23/1991</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>0qXzJ3QRqko</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14101-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Soviet Union Strikes Again, The (2001)">					<description>Soviet Union Strikes Again, The (2001)</description>					<rom name="Soviet Union Strikes Again, The (2001).zip" size="594408"/>							<plot>Following a great increase in terrorism, internal strife and ultimately, the nuclear destruction of Washington, D.C., the United States shatters into a half-dozen nation-states that descend into war.

Space Ace introduced a few gameplay enhancements, most notably selectable skill levels and multiple paths through several of the scenes. At the start of the game the player could select one of three skill levels; &quot;Cadet&quot;, &quot;Captain&quot; or &quot;Ace&quot; for easy, medium and hard respectively - only by choosing the toughest skill level could the player see all the sequences in the game (only around half the scenes are played on the easiest setting). A number of the scenes had &quot;multiple choice&quot; moments when the player could choose how to act, sometimes by choosing which way to turn in a passageway, or by choosing whether or not to react to the on-screen &quot;Energize!&quot; message and transform back into Ace.[1] Most scenes also have separate reverse versions of each other. Dexter usually progresses through scenes by avoiding obstacles and enemies, but Ace goes on the offensive, attacking enemies rather than running away; although Dexter does occasionally have to use his pistol on enemies when it is necessary to advance. An example can be seen in the first scene of the game, when Dexter is escaping from Borf's robot drones. If the player presses the fire button at the right moment, Dexter transforms temporarily into Ace and can fight them, whereas if the player chooses to stay as Dexter the robots' drill attacks must be dodged instead.[CR] - CHEATS - [CR]Entire Game Shown Completed[CR]Type 'DODEMODEXTER' during the game and it will show you the entire game, completed.[CR]</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>11/10/1999</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/16673-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Space Quest I - The Sarien Encounter (1986)">					<description>Space Quest I - The Sarien Encounter (1986)</description>					<rom name="Space Quest I - The Sarien Encounter (1986).zip" size="334774"/>							<plot>Roger Wilco is one of the most important men on the starship Arcada: he is the janitor!

Suddenly SU gets attacked by mysterious foes who kidnap Tickingclock and take away the Sorcerer's Appliance, a powerful magical device which could become extremely dangerous in inappropriate hands. Ernie has to recover the device.Equipped with his spell book and a magical guided surfboard, Ernie sets out on a mission to several islands on the Fizzbuttle Ocean in search for items that will aid him in getting into the sinister Fort Blackwand.

However, the complexity of the strategy map has been reduced (less province management) and the importance of quests and story is greater. One of the consequences is that the player is restricted to one army until two more are gained during the course of the plot.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>2000</releasedate>					<videoid>ow4cC-Cz5l8</videoid>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/17367-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/3/7/7637_front.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Strange Odyssey (1981)">					<description>Strange Odyssey (1981)</description>					<rom name="Strange Odyssey (1981).zip" size="91527"/>							<plot>You were just taking a regular old trip to an alien planet, when a big war happened to break out.

In each chamber you have to collect 6 pieces of an ancient artifact and assemble them like a jigsaw puzzle.The chambers are full of dangerous animals which you have to avoid. There's some food you can collect to regain lost health though. The chambers are also full of puzzles, usually involving manipulation of switches. You have 3 tools with you - a helmet with a headlight, jumping shoes and shields. The helmet emits a beam of light when activated; it is used to solve puzzles that rely on rotating prisms to direct a light beam to a switch. The jumping shoes allow you to, well, jump higher. The shield protects you from enemies for a short time when activated, but you have a limited number of shields and they need to be used wisely.</plot>					<genre>PlatformStrategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>VhCCFD7X09k</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25484-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/3/9/6/92396_front.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/25484-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/f/e/gfs_97155_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/3/b/gfs_97155_1_2_mid.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/a/7/gfs_97155_2_1.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/7/7/gfs_97155_2_2.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/c/7/gfs_97155_2_3.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Super Solvers Gizmos and Gadgets (1993)">					<description>Super Solvers Gizmos and Gadgets (1993)</description>					<rom name="Super Solvers Gizmos and Gadgets (1993).zip" size="1219219"/>							<plot>Super Solvers: Gizmos &amp; Gadgets is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by The Learning Company,  which was released in 1993.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>08/23/2013</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>XRwaJxCQoo0</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20837-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/8/5/43285_front.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/0/a/gfs_36375_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/c/f/gfs_36375_1_2_mid.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/8/c/gfs_36375_1_3_mid.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/b/4/5/gfs_36375_1_4_mid.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/0/6/gfs_36375_1_5_mid.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/c/3/gfs_36375_1_6_mid.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/8/0/gfs_36375_1_7_mid.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/1/2/gfs_36375_1_9_mid.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/2/c/gfs_36375_1_10_mid.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/6/f/gfs_36375_1_11_mid.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Super Solvers Midnight Rescue (1989)">					<description>Super Solvers Midnight Rescue (1989)</description>					<rom name="Super Solvers Midnight Rescue (1989).zip" size="432134"/>							<plot>Races consist of a series of checkpoints, represented by columns of light.

Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped &quot;rail-shooter&quot;, where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to &quot;pick them up&quot;. Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1989</releasedate>					<videoid>yzjWaSbd6qs</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14269-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/8/4/4/84844_front.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/3/f/gfs_86150_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/f/a/gfs_86150_1_2_mid.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/b/9/gfs_86150_1_3_mid.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/7/0/gfs_86150_1_4_mid.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/3/3/gfs_86150_1_5_mid.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/f/6/gfs_86150_1_6_mid.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/b/5/gfs_86150_1_7_mid.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/6/4/gfs_86150_1_8_mid.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/2/7/gfs_86150_1_9_mid.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/d/d/gfs_86150_1_10_mid.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Super Solvers OutNumbered (1990)">					<description>Super Solvers OutNumbered (1990)</description>					<rom name="Super Solvers OutNumbered (1990).zip" size="378647"/>							<plot>Super Solvers: Outnumbered! is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by The Learning Company,  which was released in 1989.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>08/23/2013</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>lhjQlyE-uws</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20837-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/9/9/320199_front.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/1/7/gfs_65624_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/d/2/gfs_65624_1_2_mid.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/1/6/gfs_65624_2_1_mid.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/d/3/gfs_65624_2_2_mid.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/9/0/gfs_65624_2_3_mid.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/5/9/gfs_65624_2_4_mid.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/1/a/gfs_65624_2_5_mid.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/d/f/gfs_65624_2_6_mid.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/9/c/gfs_65624_2_7_mid.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/4/d/gfs_65624_2_8_mid.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Super Solvers Spellbound (1993)">					<description>Super Solvers Spellbound (1993)</description>					<rom name="Super Solvers Spellbound (1993).zip" size="2067282"/>							<plot>Super Solvers: Spellbound! is a Miscellaneous game, developed and published by The Learning Company,  which was released in 1993.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>08/23/2013</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>E8-1CoQKaoM</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20837-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/9/5/97595_front.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Super Solvers Teasure MathStorm (1992)">					<description>Super Solvers Teasure MathStorm (1992)</description>					<rom name="Super Solvers Teasure MathStorm (1992).zip" size="697202"/>							<plot>A tremendous winter storm has wreaked havoc on Treasure Mountain, scattering the treasures and freezing the magic crown.

Toxic pollution and war have reduced the United States to a state of anarchy, except for the occasional city-state. Almost the entire area is covered by water, and dangerous mutants roam the wasteland. The player takes on the role of the Crimson Tape, the new leader of the Superhero League of Hoboken, imbued with the amazing power to Create Organizational Charts. The initial team also includes Tropical Oil Man (capable of raising the cholesterol level of his opponents), Robomop (an intelligent kitchen appliance capable of cleaning up almost any mess), Iron Tummy (capable of eating spicy foods without any distress), Captain Excitement (whose &quot;aura of lethargy and dullness&quot; can put many opponents to sleep instantly), and Mademoiselle Pepperoni (capable of seeing inside a pizza box without even opening it).The goal of the game is to complete missions assigned by the Commissioner and relayed via the League's computer, Matilda. Gradually, the player will raise Hoboken League's ranking, and finally be able to take on the evil Dr. Entropy who is seeking to thwart the rebirth of civilization. As the League's ranking and prestige grow, new superheroes with exotic names and superpowers will join up and make life easier.Gameplay is divided into adventure and role-playing sections. Adventure gameplay manifests itself in the overall structure of the game: to complete a mission, the player must travel to various locations, talk to non-playable characters, and solve predominantly inventory-based puzzles. The interface for the adventure parts of the game is similar to other late Legend Entertainment titles such as Death Gate: locations are presented as still first-person view screens, and the player selects verb commands to interact with the environment. These locations also usually contain shops where the player can buy weapons, equipment and items to outfit the heroes.The exploration of the game world that contains all the individual locations is done in a role-playing style. The player navigates the party of heroes over top-down overworld screen, gradually exploring larger areas and accessing new locations. During the exploration, enemies attack the party randomly. Combat is viewed from first-person perspective and is turn-based. Heroes have a range of stats (brawn, brains, toughness, and health) and numerous equipment slots along with their superpowers, which can be used in combat beside regular attacks. The party of heroes may include up to nine active combatants. Experience points are collected following battle victories, eventually leveling up the playable characters.The player also receives experience for fully exploring areas, as well as eliminating all the enemies in a given area (after a series of random encounters enemies eventually stop attacking). Often specific items must be acquired in order to traverse certain terrain types (e.g. deep water) or gain access to subway lines that connected between various areas. Text comments appear not only in adventure parts, but also during combat, humorously describing the course of the battle. The CD version of the game includes voice acting.</plot>					<genre>AdventureRole-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<videoid>gI0-QZ-8ehc</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25365-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/1/1/24911_front.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/1/2/24912_front.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/25365-1.jpg</boxart4>			</game>			<game name="Supernova (1987)">					<description>Supernova (1987)</description>					<rom name="Supernova (1987).zip" size="142310"/>							<plot>Mylo Steamwitz, an enterprising space trader, has set out to the perilous mines of the Altairian system. He hopes to collect enough crystals to start a profitable twibble farm. Crystal Caves is a side-scrolling platform game, where the objective is to finish all 16 levels, collecting every single crystal within. On his way, Mylo is threatened by numerous monsters, such as bats, robots, mine carts or dinosaurs; there are also a lot of hazards such as stalactites and stalagmites, pipes which leak harmful water or poisonous mushrooms which kill instantly. Mylo has three health points, and if he is harmed enough times to deplete them all, he dies (but thankfully he has unlimited lives). To defend himself, Mylo has a missile pistol, which is able to take out most enemies, but not all. Many levels require the player to act fast and plan beforehand, as it's easy to get Mylo stuck in an impossible-to-win situation - if this happens, the level must be restarted. Apart from the crystals, the levels contain a lot of items to collect: ammunition for the pistol, bonus items such as pickaxes or purple mushrooms that give score, and eggs which turn into letters when shot - collecting all 5 letters (B, O, N, U, S) on a level gives a lot of points, but it's not always easy to get them! It's also possible to find a power-up that reverses gravity when picked up, another one which gives your pistol the power to kill every enemy, a stop sign which freezes all enemies and makes them harmless and a red mushroom which allows you to kill enemies by running into them. These power-ups last only for a limited time though, so be careful, as they are always instrumental to victory!</plot>					<genre>ActionPlatform</genre>					<releasedate>10/23/1991</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14102-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Survival in New York City (1986)">					<description>Survival in New York City (1986)</description>					<rom name="Survival in New York City (1986).zip" size="90844"/>							<plot>Be a good cop or a bad cop in the streetwise action game True Crime: New York City.

The game offers elements of action, puzzle solving, and exploration as players learn more about the creature that's hunting them down. Various characters can be interacted with as the game progresses, and their reaction may depend on how well players respond to their tension. Weapons such as flamethrowers and machine guns can be used on enemies, or players can build their own weapons from parts found throughout the base.

You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.Enemies include everything the alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien) and alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>3uG6ntdrDL8</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23197-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/23197-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Timequest (1991)">					<description>Timequest (1991)</description>					<rom name="Timequest (1991).zip" size="3398726"/>							<plot>Timequest is an Adventure game, developed and published by Legend Entertainment,  which was released in 1991.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1991</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/2/0/1/25201_front.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/d/d/gfs_45789_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/1/8/gfs_45789_1_2_mid.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/5/b/gfs_45789_1_3_mid.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/d/c/gfs_45789_2_1_mid.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/1/9/gfs_45789_2_2_mid.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/5/a/gfs_45789_2_3_mid.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Tom &amp; Jerry Cat-astrophe (1990)">					<description>Tom &amp; Jerry Cat-astrophe (1990)</description>					<rom name="Tom &amp; Jerry Cat-astrophe (1990).zip" size="184326"/>							<plot>An Action-puzzler.

Objects around the levels are always detected by the cursor, making each screen and the challenges within quick to comprehend. Generally you have to solve each puzzle in sequence.Like the company's Gobliins Series, the interface is simplified, and the game has a heavier focus on self-sufficient puzzles than other traditional adventures.

Milne's Winnie the Pooh series of short stories.Each character had lost an item of value to them and wanted the item returned. The player moves through the Hundred Acre Wood and collects the missing items then returns them to their rightful owners. Only one item can be carried at a time, so picking up one item means leaving behind of whatever item is currently being carried. Some screens have interactive sub elements. For example: you could &quot;climb&quot; Pooh's tree and see the limb where he kept his honey pots safely out of the reach of flood waters (a reference to a scene in the Disney animated movie &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot;and Chapter 9 of A.A. Milne's book Winnie-the-Pooh.). The game has no animation in the mode of a traditional Quest game such as King's Quest. Rather, the Hundred Acre Wood existed as a grid of connected static screens. Players move between the screen using the arrow keys and can only move North, South, East or West. The missing items are randomly assigned at the start of each new game to screens within this grid, although the various characters can always be found on the same screens. When an item is &quot;dropped&quot; on a screen in order to &quot;pick up&quot; another item, the dropped item stays on that screen until the user returns to retrieve it later.Reuniting a character with their item results in a celebration screen.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1986</releasedate>					<videoid>dZ2vFNEy9I8</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12965-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/12965-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/c/c/gfs_36619_1_1_mid.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/c/d/gfs_36619_2_1_mid.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/0/8/gfs_36619_2_2_mid.jpg</snapshot3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/12965.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Wishbringer (1985)">					<description>Wishbringer (1985)</description>					<rom name="Wishbringer (1985).zip" size="172679"/>							<plot>Wishbringer is the ideal starting point for first-time interactive fiction players.
