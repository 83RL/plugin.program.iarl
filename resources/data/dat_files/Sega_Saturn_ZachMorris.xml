The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking.

Like previous titles, the game is an airline management simulation however graphics and interface have been updated to 3D. Players take control of an airline as it's CEO, and must first select the name, tail logo and home airport of their airline. The game is turn-based between each airline. Each airline has four &amp;quot;board members&amp;quot; who can be assigned to perform various tasks, which take varying length to accomplish. These tasks include buying aircraft, bidding for slots at an airport, buying facilities at an airport and marketing a PR campaign in a region. Once the player has purchased aircraft, they must further make planning of the route between two airports with available slots. Once a route is setup, the player is able to manage how many planes fly the route daily and the number of passengers they carry, as well as ticket price.The game is played over one of two scenarios, each representing a different era. The game is over when any airline reaches the target money amount.</plot>					<genre>Simulation</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-4s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31350-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Airs Adventure (Jpn)">					<description>Airs Adventure (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fairsadve%2Fairs%20adventure%20%28japan%29.chd" size="368315073"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Game Studio</studio>					<plot>Airs Adventure takes place in an environment reminiscent of 17th century Europe.

As they and their powers grew, the Black Dragon Vlag, hungry to devour this power and make it his own, began a campaign of assault against the siblings and their kingdom. Together, the Eldean clan was able to defeat Vlag, and with the killing strike were showered in his vile blood and imbibed with immortality. Fargasta ascended into a prosperous age under the leadership of their fabled heroes, but this period of revelry was soon cut short as Radoria began to descend into a madness that stemmed from his claiming of the foul sword Madriker, crafted from the soul of the vanquished Black Dragon. As his madness, and power, grew, he claimed the title of &amp;quot;Immortal Emperor&amp;quot; and set about imposing his will upon the lands, destroying all that was pure and crushing any who opposed him and his fiend-sword Madriker. The black tide that had swallowed his soul soon threatened to swallow everything. In a final act of desperation, Cirrus called upon the one power she had hidden from her brothers and transformed herself into the Holy Sword of Eldean, equipping to Estan and allowing him to cast a mighty blow towards Radoria, causing a blast that sent tremors throughout the lands entire. As the dust settled on the battleground, there was to be no trace of any of the Eldean clan; all had vanished, and all the people believed the Legend of Eldean had come to its tragic conclusion.Generations of relative peace passed following the fateful battle between the Eldean siblings, but with time the ancient truces that united the land during Radoria's scourge began to unravel. War and unrest began to take root, new agents of evil began to take power and the violence spread out to all corners of the world. Pike, a young boy whose parents were murdered at the outset of this new unrest, while he was still just an infant, awakes one morning in his home in the Harpy Village, where he was taken by Laia, the harpy that found him after his parents' demise. The Harpy Village had managed to remain isolated from the troubles brewing elsewhere until this morning, when it is attacked by a dark, dragon-mounted warrior named Belnard on a ruinous quest to collect all the Power Crystals in the land, one of which is housed in the Harpy Village. During the attack, Laia is petrified by Belnard, forcing Pike to gather his courage and venture forth from the Village. Armed with his father's old magical, talking sword, Cirrus, Pike sets out on a quest to save Laia and all that he holds dear; soon taking up allies that join him on his quest to stop the evil Belnard and the dark forces he works for from conquering the world.Players assume the role of Pike as he travels the land, gaining 4 comrades to help in his quest, fighting menu-driven battles and exploring towns and dungeons. The player controls their inventory and party by use of items and magic, equipping of weapons and armor and monitoring the status of party characters. While traveling from town to town or exploring dungeons, the player will be engaged in random encounters by enemies unseen on the screen or overworld. Each character's agility skill determines the order of turns during combat. Battles reach their conclusion when either all of the enemies or all of Pike's party have been depleted of their hit points. Winning a battle nets the player experience points, gold and occasionally an item. Running from a battle is also an option, though this results in nothing gained. If all of the player's party is slain during the battle, the game will be over. The player will come across shops selling items and equipment in each town they come across, at which the player can use gold earned from winning battles or selling outdated equipment to purchase new wares. Magic and skills play a large role in battles, with characters calling upon their stores of MP to utilize them in lieu of standard attacks during battle.Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean is a standard Japanese-style Turn-Based RPG. Though released on the 32-bit Sega Saturn, it is visually reminiscent of other classic top-down 16-bit SNES RPGs. The extra graphical horsepower is used to make things just a bit crisper, clearer and more vibrant than its predecessors. It also utilizes its fifth-generation capabilities in the form of CD-quality audio for the thoroughly composed soundtrack, and the occasional voiceover, most prominently in the opening intro. Players will take their party of 5 characters through several cities and dungeons, traversing to and from each on a minimal overworld map rife with random encounters. Each character gains experience and levels up independently, with stats gained and spells learned automatically with progression. Combat occurs in typical Turn-Based fashion, with options for each character to attack, use magic, use an item, defend or run. Though power-leveling is easy due to the frequent random encounters, it is not greatly needed thanks to the abundance of boss battles and the high amount of experience gained from winning each one. Through the majority of the game, the highest-caliber weapons and armor are bought from the cities' shops, but the most powerful of these items are found in longer, more complex endgame dungeons. The game is split into 2 chapters, the 2nd taking place a few years after the 1st and building upon a plot thread started in it. Legend of Eldean is part of the Albert Odyssey series, with 2 previous Japan-only releases on SNES, although there is no continuation of storyline established in the first 2 Albert Odyssey's in Legend of Eldean, save for a few reference to Albert, the main character of the original, and some of his exploits. Legend of Eldean also differs from the previous entries through its Turn-Based combat, where the first 2 employed a Tactical style. It is not fully known to what extent the translation team at Working Designs stuck to the original Japanese script. Their conversion brings with it many pop-culture references (some timeless, some definitely rooted in the time of release), 4th wall-breaking allusions and humorous punchlines and non-sequiturs; mostly through the brief interactions the player can engage in with NPC townsfolk, but even interjected into the more plot-crucial conversations and events taking place with the fairly large cast of important characters involved, breaking mold with what would have been an otherwise standard fantasy-fare storyline and setting.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31337-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54686-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282778-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54687-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54688-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282779-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282780-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282781-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100573-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-screenshot-in.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100574-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-screenshot-in.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/100575-albert-odyssey-legend-of-eldean-sega-saturn-screenshot-world.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Assault Suit Leynos 2 (Jpn)">					<description>Assault Suit Leynos 2 (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Faleynos2%2Fassault%20suit%20leynos%202%20%28japan%29.chd" size="291927494"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>NCS</studio>					<plot>Released in Japan</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>02/21/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9195-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Alien Trilogy (USA)">					<description>Alien Trilogy (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Falientri%2Fsat-0720-alien_trilogy-usa.chd" size="267546447"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>					<plot>Every now and then a game spawned from film hits the mark, and Alien Trilogy captures the gruesome essence of one of Hollywood's best high-tension thriller/action offerings. Simply put, this is an excellent video game and to date it's perhaps the best Doom-clone to bloody the consoles.From the colony of LV-426 to the Alien spaceship (which brought the plague to the infested prison colony), all of the 30-some levels pay tribute to the films. Whimpering people are encrusted in the Alien-ified walls (who explode when you shoot them, or spurt chestbursters to punish the loitering Colonial Marine), towering Alien Queens that attack with relentless abandon, sleeping tanks (inspired by the films), and eggs that lazily slip open when a hurting Marine can least afford it.Alien Trilogy also delivers the arsenal Colonial Marines will die to get their hands on. Ranging from a Beretta to a steadicam-mounted smart rifle, Acclaim provides enough firepower for the experienced Marine to show every Alien Queen who's boss. The weapons also enjoy their trademark sounds from the films, including the high-pitched jam of the pulse rifle. Like the films, Alien Trilogy employs incredible savvy in how it uses sound. There's just you and the dark, moody music, the pulse-quickening hum of the motion tracker, and two sets of jaws at every turn.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>12/31/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2421-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2421-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66462-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/186024-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2421-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66463-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163460-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/186023-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/186025-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161220-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-loading-screen-pal-version.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161221-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen-pal-version.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161222-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-mission-briefing-german.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161223-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-game-1-pal-version.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161224-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-game-2-pal-version.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161225-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-game-3-pal-version.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161226-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-game-4-pal-version.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/161227-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-game-5-pal-version.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/317096-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-loading-screen-german.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/317097-alien-trilogy-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-the-first-squad.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2421-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2421.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Alone in the Dark - Jack is Back (USA)">					<description>Alone in the Dark - Jack is Back (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Falondrk2%2Fat-0792-alone_in_the_dark-usa.chd" size="103301398"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Infogrames</studio>					<plot>The original game's horror theme has been significantly de-emphasized in the sequel. While there are some supernatural goings-on (Voodoo black magic), the main villains are gangsters and pirates. While the enemies are revealed to be possessed by evil spirits, and are green and zombie-like in appearance, they are far from the shambling walking corpses of the first game, and walk, talk, and behave much like ordinary people, arming themselves with Tommy Guns and shouting at the player. The game world is larger than that of the original, encompassing not only the mansion, but also the surrounding gardens as well as a pirate ship hidden in caverns beneath the house. Although much of the game is spent playing as Carnby, the player will occasionally take control of Grace Saunders. Grace, a child, cannot fight and is instantly captured if the gangsters spot her, so instead she must sneak around and defeat the gangsters by turning common household objects into booby traps.</plot>					<genre>HorrorPuzzle</genre>					<releasedate>02/23/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9613-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9613-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15524-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24855-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15525-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24856-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24857-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/9613-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212865-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212852-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-1.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212853-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-2.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212854-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-pretty-agile-for.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212855-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-mom-the-creepy.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212856-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-an-out-of-shape.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212857-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-tonight-you.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212858-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-i-ll-swallow-your.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212859-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-oh-the-super-low.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/9613-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9613.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Amagi Shien (Jpn)">					<description>Amagi Shien (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Famagishi%2Famagi%20shien%20%28j%29%20%28t-1513g%29.chd" size="383822863"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Clip House</studio>					<plot>In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery. Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.

that each side will blame the other. The game has a linear structure, based on levels that present tasks of increasing difficulty, and all sorts of hazards and targets are encountered. These include military bases, power generators, land mines, infantry, tanks, submarines -- even sharks and huge, aggressive birds. Infantry elements are poorly armored, so they can be killed by being run over. In one mission, the only way that the player will be able to get enough time to escape is to open with a surprise attack, slowing pursuit by destroying a parking facility full of unattended troop transport vehicles. Power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. The Slambird carries a variety of explosive devices and line-of-sight weapons. Some of the explosive weapons can bounce in a parabolic trajectory, and in addition there are two laser cannons that can fire rapidly an unlimited number of times. These cannons are useful in case no other weapons remain, and they can be used to create complex ripple fire, which can be used to cover an area that is surprisingly wide. When underwater, propellers are used, while torpedoes are automatically used instead of missiles.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/17/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10489-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15524-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24855-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/10489-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15525-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24856-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24857-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212865-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212852-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-1.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212853-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-2.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212854-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-pretty-agile-for.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212855-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-mom-the-creepy.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212856-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-an-out-of-shape.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212857-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-tonight-you.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212858-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-i-ll-swallow-your.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212859-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-oh-the-super-low.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212860-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-why-bother-with.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="America Oudan Ultra Quiz (Jpn)">					<description>America Oudan Ultra Quiz (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Famoudan%2Famerica%20oudan%20ultra%20quiz%20%28japan%29.chd" size="203091811"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Victor Entertainment</studio>					<plot>In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead. Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery. Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies. </plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15524-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24855-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15525-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24856-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24857-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212865-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212852-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-1.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212853-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-2.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212854-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-pretty-agile-for.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212855-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-mom-the-creepy.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212856-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-an-out-of-shape.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212857-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-tonight-you.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212858-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-i-ll-swallow-your.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212859-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-oh-the-super-low.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212860-alone-in-the-dark-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-why-bother-with.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Goiken Muyou - Anarchy in the Nippon (Jpn)">					<description>Goiken Muyou - Anarchy in the Nippon (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fanarchy%2Fgoiken%20muyou%20~anarchy%20in%20the%20nippon~%20taikenban%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0895%29.chd" size="49589226"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>KSS</studio>					<plot>Goiken Muyou: Anarchy in the Nippon is a 3D fighting game in the vein of Virtua Fighter (it must be noted that this game was developed by ex-AM2, VF2 staff).

While dialogues use typical anime character style to represent characters, each of the main heroines also has a small figure-like character that represents her. They come in five different degrees of emotions between love and hate, the middle one being neutral, neither loving nor hating you. The game features animations for certain memorable events, while the dialogues mostly use static images with different postures.

The player character is a high-school sophomore student, whose name, nickname, birth date and blood type is decided by the player at the beginning of the game. One day, while walking through the park, you notice a beautiful girl, but don't really manage to make a good impression on her and she soon goes away. The next day, your homeroom teacher announces you have a new student joining your class ... her name is Misuzu Amano ... the girl you met a day ago in the park. Your luck didn't completely run out as now you will have plenty of time to try and make an impression on her and possibly make her fall in love with you. But she is not the only girl in school that caught your eyes, so you will have to decide who is your person of interest and who you will try to woo. Luckily for you, you are not alone on your quest, you will have a help from heaven itself, an angel by the name Eve, who will often give you advice on girls' feelings.The basic gameplay is similar to visual novel style with dialogues and occasional selectable answers, but while you're in your room you'll be able to perform some other actions such as study, work part-time to earn some income, ask Eve for advice, set events on your calendar, join the school clubs and similar options. While dialogues use typical anime character style to represent characters, each of the main heroines also has a small figure-like character that represents her. They come in five different degrees of emotions between love and hate, the middle one being neutral, neither loving nor hating you. The game features animations for certain memorable events, while the dialogues mostly use static images with different postures. Voice-acting is included but is not complete, meaning even the heroines that talk during dialogues do not talk throughout all of their dialogues bust only some of them.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>09/13/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31343-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/297546-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/297547-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/297548-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/297549-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754591-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-main.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754592-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-opening.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754593-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-angel.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754594-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-enter.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754595-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-talking.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754596-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-wakey.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754597-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-noticing.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754598-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-trying.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754599-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-while.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/754600-angel-graffiti-anata-e-no-profile-sega-saturn-screenshot-checking.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Angelique Special (Jpn)">					<description>Angelique Special (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fangspec%2Fangelique%20special%20%28t-7615g%29.chd" size="270267580"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Koei</studio>					<plot>Angelique Special is an enhanced version of the original Angelique for Super Famicom (SNES).

The player is tasked, along with fellow STAAR members, to penetrate Area 51 and activate the nuclear self-destruct sequence. The player must kill all of the genetically altered soldiers and aliens without harming any allied STAAR team members (at the cost of one life point), however if nothing but three STAAR team members are shot, the Kronn Hunter will be started, taking the role of a Hunter, sent by the Kronn to eliminate the rebels. None of the actual aliens will appear until the office level. There are five types of different weaponry available to the player during the course of the game. While the player is only given a semi-automatic pistol in the beginning, weapon upgrades are available as targets throughout the game. The pistol can be upgraded to an automatic machine gun, a pump shotgun, and finally an automatic shotgun. The shotgun weaponry allows a greater field of error for targeting an enemy in able to kill it. Both the machine gun and automatic shotgun allow the player to keep the trigger pressed down to unleash rounds. If the player is hit by the enemy at any time, the weapon is downgraded back to the pistol. The player will also find grenades in crates and bonus rooms which, when used, destroys most on screen enemies at once. The player can hold a max of 9 grenades. In addition, yellow boxes and barrels marked with &quot;flammable&quot; warning symbols can be shot to cause fires or explosions that can harm enemies.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9614-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59962-area-51-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59642-area-51-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164488-area-51-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/9614-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59961-area-51-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59963-area-51-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59643-area-51-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164489-area-51-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164490-area-51-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/440216-area-51-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/440217-area-51-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/440218-area-51-sega-saturn-screenshot-practice-mode.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/440219-area-51-sega-saturn-screenshot-statistic.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/440220-area-51-sega-saturn-screenshot-stage-select.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/440221-area-51-sega-saturn-screenshot-we-re-getting-shot-at.jpg</snapshot6>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9614.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="All-Star Baseball 1997 featuring Frank Thomas (USA)">					<description>All-Star Baseball 1997 featuring Frank Thomas (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fasbase97%2Fsat-0745-allstar_baseball_97-usa.chd" size="287087598"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>					<plot>This baseball game is the follow up to Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball.

Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a &quot;wire framed&quot; virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>09/11/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12201-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/12201-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Astal (USA)">					<description>Astal (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fastal%2Fastal%20%28u%29.chd" size="455593263"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Somewhere in the universe, The Goddess Antowas created a world from a single jewel.

And from a red Jewel, a boy: Astal, whose purpose was to protect Leda. Content with her creation, Antowas slept.While she slept, the evil Jerado tried to take over Quartilia. To ensure victory, Jerado created a warrior: Geist. Geist kidnapped Leda, and held her at the bottom of the ocean. In an effort to get her back, Astal tore Quartilia apart, awakening Antowas. As punishment, Antowas banished Astal to Quartilia's moon. Leda took pity on Astal, and gave him her jewel. Once Astal and Jerado were dealt with, Antowas went back to sleep.However, Geist was still free, and Quartilia was not restored from the changes Jerado wrought. From his prison on the moon, Astal witnessed Geist kidnap Leda again. Consumed with the need to protect her, he freed himself and returned to Quartilia. Now Astal journeys in search of Leda through a Quartilia transformed by Jerado's dark design, along with a strange bird who for some reason just won't leave him alone...</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>04/27/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>qHHfdeFZRoU</videoid>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/10493-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10493-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/29531-astal-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34926-astal-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/10493-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/29532-astal-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/50850-astal-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66472-astal-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170257-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-an-ornate-stage-title-card.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170258-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-our-hero-at-the-start-of-his.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170259-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-astal-uses-a-tree-in-the-offensive.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170260-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-astal-rescues-a-bird-who-will.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170261-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-crystal-archers-who-fire-arrows.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170262-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-stage-2-into-the-darkness.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170263-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-this-stage-occasionally-turns.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170264-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-only-to-be-lit-up-by-a-gaggle.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170265-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-there-is-a-boss-at-the-end-of.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/170266-astal-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-still-comic-strip-like-cutscene.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/10493.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Astra Superstars (Jpn)">					<description>Astra Superstars (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fastrass%2Fastra%20superstars%20%28japan%29.chd" size="450987847"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Sunsoft</studio>					<plot>A one-on-one 2D fighting game, Astra Superstars pits all the champions of the magical kingdom against each other in a series of 3-round fights to earn the right to challenge the evil Satan Volte and try to put an end to his reign of terror.Seeing as how all the fighters have magical abilities, the fights take place in mid-air, allowing you and your opponent to fly all over the arena while you try to defeat each other using your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific controller motions) and super attacks (which deplete your energy bar but cause tremendous damage).Graphics-wise the games uses 2D sprites, with colorful doll-ish designs.

There is also Arcade Mode which, unsurprisingly, is a straight port of the arcade game. In this you can select which of 5 events you want to play from day one but must achieve a qualifying mark on that event in order to progress.

When they are joined together, they pop.This game completely abandons the idea of previous titles that the playfield is being pushed down by some sort of mechanical device and instead attaches groups of bubbles to nodes that move downwards. When a node is no longer connected to any bubbles it will disappear and when all nodes in a level have vanished the level is complete. One result of this change that may appear strange to players of previous versions is that shooting a bubble to the top of the visible playfield without striking any bubbles causes it to bounce and start travelling back downwards. The player is not penalised if such bubbles again leave the playing field without attaching to anything (except for adding to the number of moves until the field is pushed down by one empty line).</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2459-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67983-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163449-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2459-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67984-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/67985-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163450-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163451-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714487-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714488-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-fireworks-intro.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714489-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-selecting-the-game.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714490-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-stage-intro.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714491-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-first-match-against.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714492-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-another-stage-intro.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714493-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-lost-blinded-by-love.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714494-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-stage-in-puzzle.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/714495-bust-a-move-again-sega-saturn-screenshot-edit-mode.jpg</snapshot9>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2459.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Baroque (Jpn)">					<description>Baroque (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fbaroque%2Fbaroque%20%28japan%29.chd" size="302952355"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>ESP</studio>					<plot>The Armageddon came.

The player pilots the agile AH-69 Mohawk, an advanced combat helicopter with a powerful arsenal of weaponry. The game consists of seven campaigns that take place in different areas, and each campaign has a number of different missions. In addition to search-and-destroy objectives, there are hostages that require saving. The game has drawn comparisons with Soviet Strike, another helicopter simulator released in the same year. However, Black Dawn resembles an arcade game rather than a typical simulator, not least because various power-ups are obtained from destroyed enemies.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>01/14/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9881-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9881-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89879-black-dawn-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89881-black-dawn-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89880-black-dawn-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9881.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Black Fire (Euro)">					<description>Black Fire (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fblckfire%2Fbfire.chd" size="237886988"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Virgin Interactive</studio>					<plot>In Black Fire, the player takes control of the most sophisticated helicopter on the planet taking on a very dangerous enemy.

They took control of the world and reversed the ideology of the angels to suit their own demonic nature. The most positive and beautiful emotions belonged to the seven mortal sins. Angels were deprived of their rights and had to exist as slaves, obeying their demon masters in everything. You play an angel named Abel. In the beginning, you choose your master from several available characters. Your master, however, is soon accused of love - one of the seven greatest sins. You have to escape from prison, where you were thrown shortly after your master was banned, and to find a way to save your master.Black/Matrix is a strategy RPG that is divided into large battles and story sequences. You fight in turn-based mode by moving your party members on an isometric battle field, attacking and using magic, for which you require blood of defeated enemies. The experience points you gather after the battle can then be divided among your party members the way you like.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG), Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31374-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/217563-black-matrix-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/507833-black-matrix-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/507834-black-matrix-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/507835-black-matrix-sega-saturn-screenshot-choose-your-master.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/507836-black-matrix-sega-saturn-screenshot-first-scene.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/507837-black-matrix-sega-saturn-screenshot-slowly-recovering.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/507838-black-matrix-sega-saturn-screenshot-finally-got-to-do-something.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Blue Breaker - Ken Yori mo Hohoemi wo (Jpn)">					<description>Blue Breaker - Ken Yori mo Hohoemi wo (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fbluebrkr%2Fblue%20breaker%20-%20ken%20yori%20mo%20hohoemi%20wo%20%28japan%29.chd" size="421640295"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Human</studio>					<plot>The world of Blue Breaker is called &amp;quot;the path in the middle of empty sky&amp;quot;: floating islands connected with each other by bridges. It is the tradition of the people in this world that a fighter's full initiation can be completed only when he finds his true love and marries her. Such day has come now in the life of a young warrior named Kain, the hero of the game. His father explains to him that besides the usual warrior's goal of defeating the evil Dark Lord, Kain also has to find the girl of his dreams. He introduces to him a young sorceress named Asha, who becomes his first companion. But on his journey Kain meets many other young women, and it won't be so easy to choose one to whom he can give his heart!Labeled as Love Role-Playing, &amp;quot;Blue Breaker&amp;quot; is a genre-crossing game that combines traditional Japanese RPG with town and dungeon exploration, party-based combat, etc., with &amp;quot;love adventure&amp;quot;, in which your behavior towards girls influences the story. &amp;quot;Blue Breaker&amp;quot; features branching story progressing: events appear depending on the progress you have made with your female companions. Your typical RPG activities will influence your relationship with the girls. For example, if you fight too much, the girls will be tired; if you give a girl too many orders in battle (you can set battle in auto mode and only interfere occasionally) she will be displeased, and so on. It is also important to form a party in which the girls will have as few internal conflicts with each other as possible.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>11/27/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>oOBFwkiFDB8</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31380-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39016-blue-breaker-ken-yori-mo-hohoemi-o-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39017-blue-breaker-ken-yori-mo-hohoemi-o-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39018-blue-breaker-ken-yori-mo-hohoemi-o-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>			</game>			<game name="Blue Seed - Kushinada Hirokuden (Jpn)">					<description>Blue Seed - Kushinada Hirokuden (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fblueseed%2Fblue%20seed%20kushinada%20hirokuden%20%28gs-9014%29.chd" size="180935518"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Long time ago, at the dawn of Japanese legendary history, the godly princess Kushinada defeated the Aragami, monsters who drew their power from an energy source called the Blue Seed. But in every epoch, the Aragami return to bring death and destruction to Japan. Enter Momiji Fujimiya, a regular Japanese teenage girl... until she discovers that she carries the power of the princess Kushinada within her. She joins a secret government organization that specializes in fighting Aragami, receiving missions from her boss, Daitetsu Kunikida.The structure of the game is mission-based: upon receiving a mission, Momiji and the other agents (mostly young women) explore various locations in Japan, talking to people and locating the supernatural source of danger. The game has dungeon navigation, turn-based combat, and party management, but in other aspects it differs from typical Japanese RPGs. There are no random enemies, and generally not many battles. There are also no levels or experience points of any kinds. The battles utilize a card system. Depending on the character's agility (which can be increased with items), she/he can execute a number of offensive, supporting, or defensive moves by choosing a card from the available deck. Battles are won by planning and learning the enemy's strategy rather than by leveling up.Each character also has special abilities that must be used to solve puzzles. For example, one of the characters can use dynamite to blow up walls and discover hidden passages.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31382-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168114-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168115-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168116-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168117-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388484-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388480-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388482-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-our-heroine.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388483-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-cool.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388485-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-tutorial.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388486-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-preparing.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388487-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-chapter.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388488-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-heroine.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388489-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-your.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/388490-blue-seed-kushinada-hirokuden-sega-saturn-screenshot-traveling.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Saturn Bomberman Fight!!

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump from one platform to that above, or to the side, in a similar way to most platform games. The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated. Enemies turn &quot;angry&quot;  becoming pink-colored and moving faster  if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, but disappear once a player's life is lost. Contact with an enemy is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9197-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9197-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69283-bubble-bobble-also-featuring-rainbow-islands-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164618-bubble-bobble-also-featuring-rainbow-islands-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69284-bubble-bobble-also-featuring-rainbow-islands-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69328-bubble-bobble-also-featuring-rainbow-islands-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164619-bubble-bobble-also-featuring-rainbow-islands-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164620-bubble-bobble-also-featuring-rainbow-islands-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9197.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bubble Symphony (Jpn)">					<description>Bubble Symphony (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fbublsymp%2Fbubble%20symphony%20%28japan%29.chd" size="408920477"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Ving</studio>					<plot>In Bubble Symphony, you play one of four dragons - Bubblun, Bobblun, Kululun, and Cororon.

The story is very similar to the one of the  previous game: once again, the hero is lonely and is anxious to get a girlfriend, or, to be more precise, to have sex with different girls. And once again, the benevolent and gorgeous goddess Swatty is here to provide assistance, together with her side-kicks, the Seven Lucky Gods from the Japanese mythology.Even though the story is pretty much the same as in the previous game,  the gameplay underwent significant enhancements. The interface is still traditional Japanese-style menu commands, but there are many more locations now, many of which can be freely accessed by clicking on them while on the main map. Once the player has reached the point where he can begin the physical seduction of the girl, the interface switches to point-and-click, with context-sensitive cursor for touching, kissing, etc. It is necessary to try different actions more than once to understand what the girl considers pleasant and what not, otherwise the girl might get angry and the game will be over. There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously). There are also various extras (as the title implies), including an extensive album that arranges various pictures of the girls so that they tell her story, and an additional collection of stories, in which the hero can learn more about the girls he had met in the main game, and even interact with them again.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31387-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Can Can Bunny Premiere (Jpn) Disc 1">					<description>Can Can Bunny Premiere (Jpn) Disc 1</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fcancanp%2Fcan%20can%20bunny%20premiere%20%28thank%20you%20soft%29%20%28t-19704g%29.chd" size="268651525"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>KID</studio>					<plot>In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant.

Spinning all four cards gives players a Gold Key; collecting all 32 cards in the game yields a secret code. There are some forced scrolling levels in which Pepper rides on the back of his steed Barobaro. Attacking is done not with Pepper's key in these levels, but by firing Barobaro's head at enemies. An additional game mode called &quot;Bosses Galore&quot; lets the player control either Pepper or Ginger in fighting all the bosses of both Clockwork Knight games one after the other. Doing well in this mode is said to unlock a mini-game.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>10/27/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9984-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9984-2.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153748-clockwork-knight-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/9984-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153749-clockwork-knight-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153750-clockwork-knight-2-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9984.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Clockwork Knight - Pepperouchau no Fukubukuro (Jpn)">					<description>Clockwork Knight - Pepperouchau no Fukubukuro (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fcknightf%2Fclockwork%20knight%20-%20pepperouchau%20no%20fukubukuro%20%28gs-9074%29.chd" size="322269955"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III (&quot;Pepper&quot; for short) is a toy soldier.

The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking.

The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing.The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10580-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77810-criticom-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/10580-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77811-criticom-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77812-criticom-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204478-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204477-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-clip-from-the-intro-video.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204479-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-options-screen.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204480-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-fighter-selection-and-matchup.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204481-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-delara-vs-dayton.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204482-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-demonica-vs-sonork.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204483-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-exene-vs-delara.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204484-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-gorm-vs-yenji.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204485-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-yenji-inadvertently-leaps.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204486-criticom-sega-saturn-screenshot-s-i-d-vs-dayton.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/10580.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Croc - Legend of the Gobbos (UK)">					<description>Croc - Legend of the Gobbos (UK)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fcroc%2Fcroc%20-%20legend%20of%20the%20gobbos%20v1.000%20%281997%29%28fox%29%28pal%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="344776236"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Fox Interactive</studio>					<plot>All is not well in Croc's world.

Small hairy creatures called Gobbos live peacefully on an island until one day they see a basket drifting in the water. After pulling it ashore they find a baby crocodile inside it. The Gobbos raise him as their own until he is three times their size. The game starts with the island being attacked by the evil Baron Dante and his minions. They capture most of the Gobbos, but the crocodile manages to escape. Now you need to rescue the Gobbos and fight Baron Dante and his minions.As you make progress you visit several islands with different themes like a forest, snow, desert or castles. Along the way you have to collect crystals (which serve as health), rescue Gobbos and defeat enemies and bosses. You can attack enemies with your tail, destroy crates with a jump down attack and, in some stages, it is possible to swim. Secret stages and a secret island can be unlocked if all Gobbos are rescued and all jigsaw pieces in the secret stages are collected.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31372-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/16116-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24877-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/16123-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24878-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24908-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611874-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-screenshot-catch-the.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611875-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-screenshot-i-see-enemy.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611876-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-screenshot-gong.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611877-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611878-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-screenshot-lava-cave.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/611879-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-sega-saturn-screenshot-crush-the.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="The Crow - City of Angels (USA)">					<description>The Crow - City of Angels (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fcrow%2Fsat-0833-the_crow-usa.chd" size="165928093"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>					<plot>The Crow: City of Angels is a video game adaption of the 1996 film of the same name.Brought back from the dead by the mysterious crow, Ashe will stop at nothing to avenge his and his son's execution at the hands of the minions of Judah, the citys crime lord.

You are used to orders of hunting down the Resistance, a ragtag band of rebels committing sabotage and other acts of terrorism against the WEC, but slowly, you realized the WEC is not quite what it appears to be... then one day you and two other Silencers, your best buddies, were ambushed by a WEC mech patrol when it was supposed to be a routine mission. You alone survived. It is clear that the Silencer is being silenced... and the only place to turn is the Resistance... Crusader: No Remorse is the first in the series, which is best described as a 2D isometric shooter. Your silencer can roll left, roll right, kneel, jump, run, and perform other acrobatic moves. You get plenty of different weapons, from assault rifles and shotguns to grenade launchers and lasers, to really exotic weapons like microwave cannon, EMP discharger, and even plasma cannons. You're up against the full military might of the WEC, from simple guards to full-fledged Guardmechs and elite forces (though none are quite as good as you). You can find supplies and money off of killed enemies (if you left a body, that is, and some of the extreme weapons don't). You'll often need to bypass traps, open doors, disable alarms, take out security cameras, and more. The action is intense, and there's usually a bit of puzzle involved. It's often a matter of exploring the map to find a switch or a terminal with the code that'll let you access another part or another level of the map. Between missions you can chat in the Resistance base and/or buy/sell weapons. You can also find recharge stations to replenish your energy and health (you can also find batteries and first aid kits too).

In 2039, the futuristic megapolis Zero City is threatened by mutant members of a mysterious organization, who call themselves &amp;quot;Dark Visitor&amp;quot;. You, the hero of the game, join the combat unit Debugger, and are assigned to a mission of locating and exterminating the Dark Visitor. Your personal motive is revenge: your family was killed by monsters when you were a child...Cyber Doll is a futuristic RPG. You fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, that is viewed from a platform perspective. You have separate hit points for your body parts, and so do your enemies. You have a wide variety of weapons, including small guns that can target one body part of the enemy, and machine guns that cause damage to the entire body. Targeting body parts adds to combat strategy: for example, if the HP of enemy legs is depleted, he won't be able to move and to attack you in close range.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10583-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39481-cyber-doll-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39482-cyber-doll-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39483-cyber-doll-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart4>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/10583.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Cyberia (USA)">					<description>Cyberia (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fcyberia%2Fcyberia%20v1.000%20%281995%29%28interplay%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="260633998"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Interplay</studio>					<plot>In the year 2027, the world is controlled by two rival superpowers, the western-bloc Free World Alliance and the east-bloc Cartel.

The game allows limited navigation between locations, which usually lead to a puzzle or (more often) action scenes that involve either shooting down planes with a gun turret or navigating various flying vehicles, destroying enemies in a Star Wars: Rebel Assault-style confrontations.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10584-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/145201-cyberia-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66490-cyberia-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282776-cyberia-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/145202-cyberia-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164509-cyberia-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66491-cyberia-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282777-cyberia-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282775-cyberia-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282773-cyberia-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514704-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514705-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-language.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514706-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-difficulty-settings.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514707-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-cutscene.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514708-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-continue-intro.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514709-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-entering-station.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514710-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-game-menu.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514711-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-enemy-attacking-station.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514712-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-exploring-warehouse.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/514713-cyberia-sega-saturn-screenshot-scanning-crate-in-warehouse.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/10584.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Cyber Speedway (Euro)">					<description>Cyber Speedway (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fcyberspd%2Fcyber%20speedway.chd" size="291818115"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Cyber Speedway is a hover sled racing game set in the distant future.

Along your journey of the submarine, you will need to find objects such as keycards to unlock doors and better weapons.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189714-deep-fear-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189715-deep-fear-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189779-deep-fear-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369493-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369494-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369495-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-prisoner-of-the-sea.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369496-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369497-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-hmm-ugly.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369498-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-inventory.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369499-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-hang-on.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369500-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-it-s-just-a-joke-don-t-worry.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369501-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-first-briefing.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369502-deep-fear-sega-saturn-screenshot-map.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Defcon 5 (USA)">					<description>Defcon 5 (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fdefcon5%2Fdefcon%205%20v1.000%20%281995%29%28data%20east%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="197701871"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>GT Interactive</studio>					<plot>In Defcon 5, space aliens attack colony MRP-6F and turn a once peaceful evening of engineering into a battle for survival.In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software.

You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success. As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</plot>					<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89873-defcon-5-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/39035-defcon-5-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/166578-defcon-5-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89874-defcon-5-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89875-defcon-5-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40510-defcon-5-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/166580-defcon-5-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/167227-defcon-5-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/166581-defcon-5-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>			</game>			<game name="Dejig McKnight - Art Collection (Jpn)">					<description>Dejig McKnight - Art Collection (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fdejigmck%2Fdejig%20mcknight%20-%20art%20collection%20%28t-30305g%29.chd" size="76089166"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Masudaya</studio>					<plot>Street Fighter Collection is a bundle comprising several different games of the Street Fighter series.

In each chapter the player will see the events and situations from different angles and uncover layers of the main plotline.The computer versions of the game have scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations, which are not present in the console releases.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36641-desire-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36643-desire-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36644-desire-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36642-desire-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36645-desire-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36646-desire-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>			</game>			<game name="DragonHeart - Fire &amp; Steel (Euro)">					<description>DragonHeart - Fire &amp; Steel (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fdheart%2Fdh.chd" size="267184987"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>					<plot>Dragonheart: Fire and Steel was released to the public in 1996, and is a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up based off of the movie of the same name.

The game is a beat 'em up with loose ties to the Die Hard movie series of the same name.However, other than the title, the building and the fact that the hero (named Bruno Delinger in the Japanese version) resembled John McClane, the game and the movie have little to do with each other (in fact, the license was purchased when the game was essentially complete for the North American, European and Australian releases). It is a 1 or 2 player game in which the male and/or female characters fight through action-packed levels to save the President's daughter from a band of terrorists.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooterFighting</genre>					<releasedate>04/08/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2406-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2406-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/31897-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/185818-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/31898-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64309-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/185431-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/184945-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/247280-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/247281-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-screenshot-roof-fight.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/247282-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-screenshot-lots-of-foes.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/247283-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-screenshot-give-up-hell-no.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/247284-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/247285-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-screenshot-not-alan-rickman.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/247286-die-hard-arcade-sega-saturn-screenshot-cook-some-fools.jpg</snapshot7>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2406.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Die Hard Trilogy (USA)">					<description>Die Hard Trilogy (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fdiehardt%2Fdie%20hard%20trilogy%20v1.000%20%281996%29%28fox%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="333341663"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Fox Interactive</studio>					<plot>Die Hard Trilogy lets players guide New York cop John McClane through three arcade-style games based on each of the three Die Hard movies.  Each movie is represented through a totally different style, making this a &amp;quot;3 games in 1&amp;quot; style package. Die Hard is a third person action/adventure through thirty floors of the Nakatomi Tower high-rise. Terrorists have interrupted the company's Christmas party and taken hostages.  As McClane, the player must search for hostages through computer, construction, maintenance, and executive levels. McClane's default pistol holds infinite ammo, and the player can collect limited-ammo machine guns and grenades inside the levels. Walls turn transparent when they intersect the camera, allowing players to follow McClane through hallways and rooms with ease. After all the hostages on a level have been rescued, the player has 30 seconds to locate a bomb sent down by elevator, then use that elevator to move to the next level. Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a first-person arcade gun game, nearly identical to Virtua Cop. Terrorists have attacked Washington/Dulles Airport. The player automatically moves through the airport and surrounding areas &amp;quot;on rails,&amp;quot; shooting bad guys that appear from behind the scenery.  Weapon upgrade icons can be shot to be collected, and either use limited ammo, or are retained until the player is hit (identical to Lethal Enforcers). Players can also destroy parts of the environment by shooting it, which can be used to take out nearby terrorists (with explosions, or by shooting overhead items to drop on them).  This game supports pad controls, or any of the PlayStation's gun controllers.  Die Hard With A Vengeance has players racing through New York City streets in a variety of vehicles, trying to locate bombs before they explode.  A strict timer ticks off the next explosion, and the player is guided only by a direction arrow and the vocal suggestions of their co-driver. Bombs are hidden inside everyday objects (like phone booths and benches) and are defused by ramming them, which activates the timer on the next bomb. Occasional &amp;quot;bomb cars&amp;quot; must be chased and rammed until their life bar is depleted. Powerups can be collected by running over icons in the streets, and include extra time, turbo boosts, and jumps to rocket over obstacles.All three games are exaggeratedly bloody (players can run over pedestrians in Die Hard 3 and wipe the blood away with windshield wipers). Each of the three games also uses a combination of textured polygons and sprites to generate their worlds, resulting in warping textures and some quirky &amp;quot;paper doll&amp;quot; effects.</plot>					<genre>Action, Racing / Driving</genre>					<releasedate>12/31/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/15191-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69259-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/41934-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202794-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/15191-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69262-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69920-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/42320-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/165550-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202793-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>			</game>			<game name="Digital Ange - Dennou Tenshi SS (Jpn)">					<description>Digital Ange - Dennou Tenshi SS (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fdigiange%2Fdigital%20ange%20-%20dennou%20tenshi%20ss%20%28t-33003g%29.chd" size="229968126"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Tokuma Shoten</studio>					<plot>Die Hard Trilogy lets players guide New York cop John McClane through three arcade-style games based on each of the three Die Hard movies.

After all the hostages on a level have been rescued, the player has 30 seconds to locate a bomb sent down by elevator, then use that elevator to move to the next level. Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a first-person arcade gun game, nearly identical to Virtua Cop. Terrorists have attacked Washington/Dulles Airport. The player automatically moves through the airport and surrounding areas &amp;quot;on rails,&amp;quot; shooting bad guys that appear from behind the scenery.  Weapon upgrade icons can be shot to be collected, and either use limited ammo, or are retained until the player is hit (identical to Lethal Enforcers). Players can also destroy parts of the environment by shooting it, which can be used to take out nearby terrorists (with explosions, or by shooting overhead items to drop on them).  This game supports pad controls, or any of the PlayStation's gun controllers.  Die Hard With A Vengeance has players racing through New York City streets in a variety of vehicles, trying to locate bombs before they explode.  A strict timer ticks off the next explosion, and the player is guided only by a direction arrow and the vocal suggestions of their co-driver. Bombs are hidden inside everyday objects (like phone booths and benches) and are defused by ramming them, which activates the timer on the next bomb. Occasional &amp;quot;bomb cars&amp;quot; must be chased and rammed until their life bar is depleted. Powerups can be collected by running over icons in the streets, and include extra time, turbo boosts, and jumps to rocket over obstacles.All three games are exaggeratedly bloody (players can run over pedestrians in Die Hard 3 and wipe the blood away with windshield wipers). Each of the three games also uses a combination of textured polygons and sprites to generate their worlds, resulting in warping textures and some quirky &amp;quot;paper doll&amp;quot; effects.</plot>					<genre>Action, Racing / Driving</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6279-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69259-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/41934-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202794-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6279-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69262-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69920-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/42320-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/165550-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202793-die-hard-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>			</game>			<game name="Digital Pinball (USA)">					<description>Digital Pinball (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fdigipin%2Fsat-0673-last_gladiators_digital_pinball-usa.chd" size="356554934"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Digital Pinball: Necronomicon is a pinball video game created for the Sega Saturn by KaZe in 1996.

In order to defeat Madruk, Astea created a powerful dragon, who eventually emerged victorious and was able to seal Madruk away.Years have passed. Legendra is now divided into eight kingdoms. One of them, Fandaria, is ruled by a monarch named Goldark. The other kings have heard rumors that Goldark is planning to take over Legendra by conquering all the other kingdoms. Everyone is preparing for the war, without realizing that the ancient evil is about to raise its head once again...Dragon Force is a real-time strategy game (RTS). The player can choose one of the six monarchs (plus two additional ones that become available once the game is completed) with their unique scenarios. The gameplay is divided into three modes: management, overworld movement, and battle. Management mode allows the player to assign generals, decide the fate of prisoners, prepare the army for battles, etc. Navigation on the map is done in real time; once two warring armies have reached the same spot, the player is taken to a separate battle screen. The battles also evolve in real time, the goal usually being killing or capturing enemy general. If all the soldiers are killed, the two generals can opt for a duel that will decide the outcome of the battle.Each kingdom has unique &amp;quot;strong&amp;quot; fighter types, which the player should use to target the weaknesses of the opposing armies. Each fighter type also has his own special techniques and abilities.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26799-dragon-force-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48641-dragon-force-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66648-dragon-force-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48642-dragon-force-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48643-dragon-force-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59417-dragon-force-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614240-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-select-nation.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614241-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-noble-family.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614242-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-dark-army.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614243-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-it-s-a-kind-of-magic.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614244-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-nice-elvish-ears.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614245-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-land-to-move-troops-generals.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614246-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-stats.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614247-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-go-to-city.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614248-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-select-generals.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/614249-dragon-force-sega-saturn-screenshot-cut-scene.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Sugobencha -

Set in a futuristic cyberpunk environment, the game contains many characteristic elements such as two weapon types (swords and guns) for the main hero, a female companion who can learn and cast magic spells, and a party of six active combatants, of which four are demons. Like in many other Megami Tensei games, the player can communicate with randomly encountered demons and recruit them into the party by selecting appropriate dialogue choices. These demons can also be fused with each other to create more powerful ones.The loyalty system from the previous game returns; however, this installment makes it easier to raise the loyalty level of a demon. By taking a demon into battles and repeatedly performing action it likes (indicated by its comments to the player's choices), the player can gradually make it fully controllable and obedient.

It also features the same heroine as in D series. The crew members of the spaceship Aki were in a state of suspended animation. All of a sudden, the ship emergency program woke them up. What has happened? Apparently, a hostile alien life form had penetrated the spaceship. Now Laura, the heroine of the game, has to establish contact with her comrades, finding her way through the maze-like corridors of the giant vessel. She will also have to defend herself against the aliens, which seem even more intimidating because they are totally invisible.The game consists of two genres: puzzle-solving adventure and shooter. When you enter a room, the enemies can't attack you, and you can explore it from 1st person perspective, taking objects, and solving puzzles. When you wander through ship corridors, you enter the 1st person shooter mode. Since the enemies are invisible, you'll have to listen to the sounds they make. A high sound means an enemy is right in front of you; a mid-range sound means it is attacking from the side; a low-pitched noise tells you it is behind you. You can figure out the distance between you and the enemy by the intensity of the sound.</plot>					<genre>Action, Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22868-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22869-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305918-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-title-screen-actually.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305919-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-before-you-start-the-game.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305920-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-this-vr-simulation-the.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305921-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-not-afraid-yet-you-will.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305922-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-alien-who-directed-it-ridley.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305923-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-someone-has-helpfully-graffitied.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305924-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-warp-s-darling-laura-wakes.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305925-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-meanwhile-an-enraged-cameraman.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305926-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-ummm-wait-what-sorry-i-got.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/305927-enemy-zero-sega-saturn-screenshot-stop-calling-me.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="UEFA Euro 96 England (Euro)">					<description>UEFA Euro 96 England (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Feuro96%2Feuro96.chd" size="188381032"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>EU release</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-4s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11367-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56019-uefa-euro-96-england-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/167848-uefa-euro-96-england-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56020-uefa-euro-96-england-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56021-uefa-euro-96-england-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/167849-uefa-euro-96-england-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/167850-uefa-euro-96-england-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11367.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="EVE - burst error (Jpn) Disc 1">					<description>EVE - burst error (Jpn) Disc 1</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Feveburst%2Feve%20-%20burst%20error%20%28japan%29%20%28disc%201%29%20%28kojiroh%20disc%29.chd" size="219220169"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Imagineer</studio>					<plot>Eve burst error is set in modern-day Japan.

There is no party in the game: the player only controls Edge on the back of his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. Edge moves around through the game's fully 3D world by riding the dragon. In towns and some dungeons Edge can also move on foot. During battles, the player can either choose to shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of the dragons.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>04/30/1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6828-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6828-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6828-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6828-4.jpg</fanart4>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6828-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6828-1.jpg</boxart2>			</game>			<game name="Farland Story - Habou no Mai (Jpn)">					<description>Farland Story - Habou no Mai (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Ffarstory%2Ffarland%20story%20-%20habou%20no%20mai%20%28t-32505g%29.chd" size="345762698"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>TGL</studio>					<plot>The Story of Thor 2, known in Japan as Thor: Seireioukiden and the US as The Legend of Oasis, is video game on the Sega Saturn console.

Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they feel as if something is missing. Finding that the Christmas Star that usually sits at the top of the Twin Seeds Christmas tree is missing, the pair head off to Nightopia to find it. There, they meet up with Nights again and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been Christmas-ified due to the kids' dreams of the holiday season. The trio of heroes must now take down a revived Gillwing and retrieve the Christmas Star from his lair. The game uses the Saturn's internal clock to change elements of the game according to the date and time. In November and January, the title screen label &quot;Nights: Limited Edition&quot; is changed to &quot;Winter Nights&quot;, with the lush greenery of the environment being replaced by white snow. During December, &quot;Christmas Nights&quot; mode is activated, resulting in further Christmas-themed alterations, such as item boxes becoming Christmas presents, Nightopians dressing in elf costumes, and Christmas trees replacing Ideya captures. The background music is replaced by an instrumental version of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, as well as there being a &quot;Christmas-like&quot; rendition of the boss theme. During the &quot;Winter Nights&quot; period, the weather in Spring Valley will change according to what hour it is. Other cosmetic changes are visible on New Year's Day, and loading the game on April Fool's Day results in Reala replacing Nights as the playable character.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>12/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9980-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9980-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="FEDA Remake!

It takes place one year after what happened in Fighter's History. After being defeated in The &amp;quot;Great Grapple&amp;quot;, a martial arts tournament organized by himself, the mysterious K invites fighters from all over the world once again. The nine characters from the previous game (Ray, Feilin, Ryoko, Matlok, Samchay, Lee, Mizoguchi, Jean and Marstorius) are present, along with two new ones (Yungmie and Zazie). The two hidden characters from the previous game, Clown and Karnov, are also available as playable characters in this game.Each character has two punches (light and hard) and two kicks (light and hard) and one or more unique throw moves. Special moves are performed by using control sequences such as moving the directional pad down, down-forward, forward and pressing a punch button. Combos can be performed by connecting sequences of moves. A &amp;quot;one-two attack&amp;quot; system was introduced in this game: pressing a hard attack button while performing a light attack or blocking reduces the interval between light attacks, making combos easier to perform.There are two rounds in each stage, and the object of each round is to drain the opponent's energy in order to win the battle. If there is a tie after two rounds, a third round is played. The animated background for each character changes from the first to the second and third rounds. There is a time limit, and if this expires, the player with the less energy loses. The game can be played in single player or two player versus mode.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14428-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/14428.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="FIFA Soccer 96 (USA)">					<description>FIFA Soccer 96 (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Ffifa96%2Fsat-0776-fifa_soccer_96-usa.chd" size="383552518"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Electronic Arts</studio>					<plot>FIFA Soccer 96 is a football (soccer) simulation.

The game features the same world and graphics as  Angelique Special, with a slightly different story: Angelique falls asleep outside near a tree, and dreams that she fell through a rabbit hole (in an Alice in Wonderland fashion) into the magical land where she encounters her eternal rival Rosalia.Unlike other Angelique games, Fushigi no Kuni no Angelique plays like a board game, with the kingdom divided into fields on which Angelique moves. There are no visible dice, but the amount of fields Angelique can walk on is determined randomly by clicking on the &amp;quot;move&amp;quot; button. Fields can either be empty, placed inside a location (like Angelique's own room), trigger events, conversations, etc. In some places it is possible to find items, which can then be used on another field to help Angelique advance more quickly, increasing her chances to become the queen.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>			</game>			<game name="Fighting Vipers (USA)">					<description>Fighting Vipers (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Ffvipers%2Ffighting%20vipers%20v2.000%20%281996%29%28sega%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="257810378"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Electric fences.

The game is set on a nameless island, which has elements of medieval fantasy as well as futuristic civilization. It allows the player to control a party of three female students from the School of Adventuring. The player can name the girls, but not change their unique battle techniques and proficiencies. The goal of the game is to reach a higher rank than the three competing teams (also containing girls only). Each team is accompanied by a guardian elf, and might also meet and/or hire other NPCs.The game has an internal schedule, which reminds the player of the other competitors and what they might have accomplished in the meantime. Game progression is non-linear: the four cities on the island can be accessed right from the beginning. Each city contains special locations where the party can choose to accept a mission. These missions can also be completed in any order; each has an approximate difficulty label. Accepting a mission usually unlocks new hostile areas, which are inaccessible otherwise. During a mission, the game plays the same way as most other Japanese RPGs: exploring the dungeon, the party finds treasure and fights enemies in turn-based combat (viewed from first-person perspective). There are no random battles: all the enemies are visibly walking on screen and can be avoided. Combat largely relies on techniques, which are grouped by classes and are unique to each girl.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>			</game>			<game name="Gakkou no Kaidan (Jpn)">					<description>Gakkou no Kaidan (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fgakkokai%2Fgakkou%20no%20kaidan%20%28gs-9026%29.chd" size="317846011"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Gakk no Kaidan is an interactive movie with adventure elements, made to tie in with a Japanese ghost-themed film of the same name.

The puzzle pieces portray stills and videos featuring five different girls, namely Ayumi ( ), Mami ( ), Kyoko ( ), Miwako ( ), and Chiyoko ( ).The game feature three gameplay modes. Movie Puzzle mode features countdown mode where player races against time to assemble the animated jigsaw puzzle. Animated thumbnail video can be scrolled over to get the better preview. Upon completing the puzzle, the player is rewarded with fullscreen video of the girl in question, and the next jigsaw puzzle video gets unlocked. VP Puzzle mode lets you play against other player or CPU where photo is displayed only for a brief moment before the game starts. During the battle, puzzles set in place by each of the player are marked with the player's color on the grid map.

Other options include the ability to choose one of four difficulty levels, length of each half (3, 6 or 15 minutes) and weather conditions (fine, rain or random).</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>10/27/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11379-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/308786-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11379-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/308787-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/308790-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/308788-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/308789-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794391-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794392-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794393-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794394-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794395-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794396-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794397-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794398-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794399-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/794400-hiyake-no-omoide-himekuri-girls-in-motion-puzzle-vol-1-sega.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11379.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna Akitaka Mika IllustWorks 2 (Jpn)">					<description>Ginga Ojousama Densetsu Yuna Akitaka Mika IllustWorks 2 (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fgoillus2%2Fginga%20ojousama%20densetsu%20yuna%20akitaka%20mika%20illustworks%202%20%28t-14323g%29.chd" size="40014885"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Hudson</studio>					<plot>Hiyake no Omoide () is a jigsaw puzzle game for one or two players featuring photo stills and live videos.

That said, there is no nudity. It is very similar to Gals Panic 4 before it in that all the girls are drawn in an anime style, with no photographic models whatsoever. The gameplay is changed in this game. The same basic gameplay of uncovering a girl's picture with Qix-like gameplay is used, but you spend 5 rounds on each girl. After this, instead of moving on to the next girl, the game saves and ends. You then play another girl after starting the game again. There is a gallery where the unlocked CG can be viewed. There are a total 12 models in the game, the last two unlocked after beating all the available girls.

Battles occur in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.

On defense, your main objective is to tag the other player (either the computer or a friend in two-player mode) before he or she collects all the flags.In each level you will find different colored balls that will help you defeat your enemies. For example, the green balls increase your speed, red increases your magic, and blue increases your agility. The more power-ups you collect, the more efficient you become. You can also use and collect magic points.Collecting magic points allows you to do one of six things: build a temporary bridge, drop explosives behind you, slow down your opponent, fire a weapon (which can be upgraded or traded), temporarily boost your speed, or teleport out of danger.</plot>					<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7936-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218587-grid-runner-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7936-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/218588-grid-runner-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7936.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Groove on Fight - Gouketsuji Ichizoku 3 - Kakuchou Ram Cartridge-tsuki!

Additionally, the bloodlines of the Gouketsuji clan have grown thin and now the tournament has been opened to foreign families, thus resulting in a new cast of characters that all but replaces the original fighters.Gameplay-wise Groove on Fight plays as a team-based 2-on-2 2D fighting game, with each player selecting two fighters and being able to tag freely between them at any point in the fights a la X-Men vs. Street Fighter. Your objective is to defeat all the challenger teams and then face of against your teammate to decide who gets to be the new head of the clan. Also a new dodge and knockout attack has been added to the basic controls, and the game features four player simultaneous play in Vs mode.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-4s</nplayers>			</game>			<game name="Grand Slam (USA)">					<description>Grand Slam (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fgslamu%2Fsat-0779-grand_slam-usa.chd" size="76370590"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Virgin Interactive</studio>					<plot>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line.

Gulliver is a young boy who studies magic in a school in a small town in Italy, but is bored with the studies and craves adventure. After he gets his magical diploma, he goes to Venice to hook up with his best friends - the girl Misty, who has healing powers, and the genius inventor Edison. Together, they must stop the plot of the Spanish crown to dominate the world.Ks Kagaku Sekai Gulliver Boy differs greatly from the Super Famicom interpretation of the anime. Unlike that action role-playing game, it is a traditional Japanese-style turn-based RPG. It utilizes traditional battle system with a four-heroes party, physical attacks and magic, etc. Stand-out features include a money system that is based on trading rather than obtaining gold from defeated foes, and the fact that the enemies are visible on the field and the combat initiates once Gulliver comes into contact with them, rather than appearing randomly.Much of the exploration in the game is done by navigating a ship across the Mediterranean sea.

The gameplay is also largely unchanged.The main difference between the two versions is in the graphics. Many locations and cut scenes in GunBlaze S were re-drawn from scratch. Some of the locations have different layout. Generally, the graphics are clearly more detailed, even though they retain the simple 2D top-down style of the original. There are voice-overs for all story-related dialogues in this version.There is also another significant change: the original GunBlaze had scenes with nudity; GunBlaze S has none. The sexual innuendo is present in the dialogues, and there are scenes with scantily clad young girls; but the adult content is gone. </plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408034-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408035-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-london-at-night.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408036-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-mysterious-zeppelin.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408037-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-one-of-the-story-s-bad-girls.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408038-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-jewel-the-game-s-main-heroine.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408039-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-some-of-the-scenes-in-this.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408040-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-nice-config-screen-if-i.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408041-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-mark-in-his-apartment.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408042-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-outside-of-mark-s-apartment.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408043-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-instead-of-the-cool-city.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Kidou Senshi Gundam (Jpn)">					<description>Kidou Senshi Gundam (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fgundam%2Fkidou%20senshi%20gundam%20v1.000%20%281995%29%28bandai%29%28ntsc%29%28jp%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="262154099"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Bandai</studio>					<plot>This game was released only in Japan.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<releasedate>11/29/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/29251-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/29251-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408034-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408035-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-london-at-night.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408036-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-mysterious-zeppelin.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408037-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-one-of-the-story-s-bad-girls.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408038-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-jewel-the-game-s-main-heroine.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408039-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-some-of-the-scenes-in-this.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408040-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-nice-config-screen-if-i.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408041-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-mark-in-his-apartment.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408042-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-outside-of-mark-s-apartment.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408043-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-instead-of-the-cool-city.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Kidou Senshi Gundam Gaiden I -

The gameplay is also largely unchanged.The main difference between the two versions is in the graphics. Many locations and cut scenes in GunBlaze S were re-drawn from scratch. Some of the locations have different layout. Generally, the graphics are clearly more detailed, even though they retain the simple 2D top-down style of the original. There are voice-overs for all story-related dialogues in this version.There is also another significant change: the original GunBlaze had scenes with nudity; GunBlaze S has none. The sexual innuendo is present in the dialogues, and there are scenes with scantily clad young girls; but the adult content is gone. </plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/10571-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/10571-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408034-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408035-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-london-at-night.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408036-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-mysterious-zeppelin.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408037-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-one-of-the-story-s-bad-girls.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408038-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-jewel-the-game-s-main-heroine.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408039-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-some-of-the-scenes-in-this.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408040-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-nice-config-screen-if-i.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408041-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-mark-in-his-apartment.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408042-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-outside-of-mark-s-apartment.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/408043-gunblaze-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-instead-of-the-cool-city.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/10571.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Gungriffon II (Jpn)">					<description>Gungriffon II (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fgungrif2%2Fgungriffon%20ii%20%28t-4510g%29.chd" size="358309545"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>ESP</studio>					<plot>Gungriffon II is 3D FPP mecha simulator, similar to  Armored Core or Mechwarrior, continuation of Gungriffon, released only in Japan.

The environmental protection agency Goa Del maintained the planet. However, in the name of self-defense, Goa Del began to develop weaponry against the wishes of the house of lords, El Doral, and eventually war broke out between the two groups. The queen of El Doral sent her young daughter Rabis on a shuttle to Earth, but in an attack, the shuttle was separated from the convoy and made an emergency landing on the moon. In a last-ditch effort, El Doral brought the way to an end with the &amp;quot;organic weapon&amp;quot; HN-01, and the defeated Goa Del fled into the reaches of space.Two thousand years later, the descendants of Goa Del, now calling themselves the Baskille Empire, are rapidly expanding their power. One day, a bright light appears near Venus, and the Baskille Empire has appeared, returning to take back their planet. And now, three sisters living on Earth, distant descendants of El Doral, have gotten caught up in the fight.Harukaze Sentai V-Force is an isometric strategy RPG similar to Front Mission or Super Robot Taisen. The game follows Natsuki, Mizuki, and Kagetsu, three sisters who are pilots in the Earth Defense Force. Each mission allows you to configure your character's weaponry, and as they fight, they will gain experience and level up. Before and after each mission, fully-animated cutscenes drive the plot forward, and sometimes they will appear at crucial points during a mission as well.</plot>					<genre>Role-PlayingStrategy</genre>					<releasedate>12/11/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23768-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/211949-harukaze-sentai-v-force-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/211950-harukaze-sentai-v-force-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="Harukaze Sentai V-Force (Jpn) Disc 2">					<description>Harukaze Sentai V-Force (Jpn) Disc 2</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fharukaze%2Fharukaze%20sentai%20v-force%20disc%202%20%28t-19904g%29.chd" size="312890510"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Ving</studio>					<plot>Scenario 2, Target: Child of God, features Medion, Prince of Destonia, and youngest of three sons of Emperor Domaric. Although loyal to his father and his country, he senses that there are other forces at work beneath the tensions between Aspinia and Destonia. He attends the conference in Saraband on behalf of Destonia, along with his brothers Arrawnt and Mageron. As discovered in Scenario 1, much of this influence comes from the Bulzome sect, as well as collaborating separatist factions within both Destonia and Aspinia. Medion works parallel to Synbios of Aspinia, often disposing of rogue Aspinian elements to spare Synbios's force from fighting against its own countrymen. At the end of the game, Medion is forced to battle with Synbios' force when Julian steps in to stop them.</plot>					<genre>Role-PlayingStrategy</genre>					<releasedate>04/29/1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11177-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11177-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11177-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11177-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/211949-harukaze-sentai-v-force-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11177-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/211950-harukaze-sentai-v-force-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11177.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Harukaze Sentai V-Force (Jpn) Disc 3">					<description>Harukaze Sentai V-Force (Jpn) Disc 3</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fharukaze%2Fharukaze%20sentai%20v-force%20disc%203%20%28t-19904g%29.chd" size="344865775"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Ving</studio>					<plot>Scenario 3, Bulzome Rising, stars Julian, a mercenary who appears as a secondary character in both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father.Julian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny.Scenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 &amp; 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some &quot;overlap&quot;.

though the title might lead one to believe it is a remake.This game takes place after the events of the first game. The souls of the hidden mansion have asked you to return, because they have recognized that you possess special powers that allow you to see the butterfly manifestations of the souls living there. Something terrible is afoot at the mansion, and you must investigate things and set them right. Along the way you must discover the true purpose of the mansion and it's significance in the universe.Much like the Sega CD game, this is an FMV adventure. You move from location to location via video sequences, and solve puzzles to move on in the story.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2423-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69384-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147679-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253537-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2423-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69392-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69387-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147680-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164147-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253538-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208265-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-on.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208266-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-and.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208267-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-title.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208268-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-souls.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208269-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-here-we.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208270-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-library.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208271-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-elder.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208272-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-err-who.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208273-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-enter-the.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208274-the-mansion-of-hidden-souls-sega-saturn-screenshot-more-shots.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2423.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="High Velocity - Mountain Racing Challenge (USA)">					<description>High Velocity - Mountain Racing Challenge (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_1%2Fhighvelo%2Fhigh%20velocity%20-%20mountain%20racing%20challenge%20v1.002%20%281995%29%28atlus%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="255080298"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<plot>High Velocity is an arcade-style racing game that allows the player to drive sports cars on twisty roads around Japanese mountain tops.

There are six hover cars to choose from: the fast Flexiwing and Outrider, the balanced KD-1 Speeder and Vampyr and the slow but armed to the teeth Berserker and Jugga. In addition to the natural capacity of each, their Minigun, Missle and Booster capacities can be upgraded by picking up powerups during the race.

While the minigun has unlimited ammo, both fuel, armour and missiles must be replenished by passing through some marked areas or picking up powerups in the track or by left destroyed opponents. While the vehicles float on the track they are still influenced by the ground material: they slow down on dirt and even more on water. Each track has a number of shortcuts or alternate routes that offer powerups, and some tracks feature gates and ramps that open or close randomly.Includes 9 tracks and several game modes (for Saturn owners and PC players with the 1.2 patch installed) such as single race mode (with option to change the number of laps), a Championship mode, Split Screen, Clone Race (beating the ghost of the best race time), Death Match (Where instead of finishing first what matters is finish alive and with the most kills) and Hot Seat, where up to eight players can compete in the same race by taking turns, with the computer taking control of the players' vehicles waiting for their turn.

This entails flying around the 3D level and taking out targets such as: communication uplinks, shield generators, the occasional alien fighter craft, and ultimately bringing down the major alien ship via a strike on its main cannon.

A total of 24 ingenious puzzles must be solved, each independent of the others. Most of them can be played in two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard), and the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest.  The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.  </plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11282-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11282-1.jpg</boxart2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11282.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius - Forever with Me (Jpn)">					<description>Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius - Forever with Me (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fjikkparo%2Fjikkyou%20oshaberi%20parodius%20-%20forever%20with%20me%20%28japan%29.chd" size="150630523"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<plot>This game is the fourth game in the series of parody shooters produced by Konami and was released only in Japan. The gameplay is stylistically very similar to the Gradius series, but the graphics and music are intentionally absurd. The game, as its name would suggest (translated: &quot;Chatting Parodius Live&quot;), contains a large amount of Japanese voice samples shouted out in a style similar to that of a game show host.Unlike the previous titles, this game was not created originally as an Arcade game. Instead, it was originally released on the japanese Super Famicom and this port is an upgraded version of that one, featuring not only improved graphics and sound from the Super Famicom game, but some altered levels and bosses, including a cheat to replace &quot;Tokimeki People's Dance&quot; with an enhanced version, &quot;Days Of The Dream's Memories&quot;. Also added were several &quot;Omake&quot; stages and an unlockable Dracula-kun and Kid Dracula as a playable character. In a two-player game, both players can now choose to play simultaneously instead of just alternately in the Super Famicom game.This game was also released on the Sony PlayStation with little differences compared to this version.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>12/13/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25570-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220039-jikkyo-oshaberi-parodius-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/25570-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220040-jikkyo-oshaberi-parodius-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220037-jikkyo-oshaberi-parodius-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220038-jikkyo-oshaberi-parodius-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>			</game>			<game name="Jikuu Tantei DD - Dracula Detective - Maboroshi no Lorelei (Jpn) Disc 1">					<description>Jikuu Tantei DD - Dracula Detective - Maboroshi no Lorelei (Jpn) Disc 1</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fjikudrac%2Fjikuu%20tantei%20dd%20disc%201%20%28j%29%20%28t-2103g%29.chd" size="272290532"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>ASCII</studio>					<plot>Jikuu Tantei DD is a detective noir adventure game with a futuristic setting.

The gameplay is stylistically very similar to the Gradius series, but the graphics and music are intentionally absurd. The game, as its name would suggest (translated: &quot;Chatting Parodius Live&quot;), contains a large amount of Japanese voice samples shouted out in a style similar to that of a game show host.Unlike the previous titles, this game was not created originally as an Arcade game. Instead, it was originally released on the japanese Super Famicom and this port is an upgraded version of that one, featuring not only improved graphics and sound from the Super Famicom game, but some altered levels and bosses, including a cheat to replace &quot;Tokimeki People's Dance&quot; with an enhanced version, &quot;Days Of The Dream's Memories&quot;. Also added were several &quot;Omake&quot; stages and an unlockable Dracula-kun and Kid Dracula as a playable character. In a two-player game, both players can now choose to play simultaneously instead of just alternately in the Super Famicom game.This game was also released on the Sony PlayStation with little differences compared to this version.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>12/13/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25570-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55652-jonah-lomu-rugby-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/25570-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55653-jonah-lomu-rugby-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55654-jonah-lomu-rugby-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>			</game>			<game name="J.

The gameplay of the system has been altered with the addition of &amp;quot;Rush&amp;quot; multi-hit combos and new moves for practically every character. The storyline of the series receives heavy focus in this release with the Orochi Saga swinging into high-gear.The King of Fighters '96 has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default &amp;quot;Team Fighting&amp;quot; mode or the traditional &amp;quot;Single Fighter&amp;quot; style of gameplay, plus the &amp;quot;Versus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Survival&amp;quot; gameplay modes.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66661-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66662-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/509108-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/509109-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/509110-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-screenshot-select-your.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/509111-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-screenshot-loading-screen.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/509112-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-match-just.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/509113-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-screenshot-k-o.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/509114-the-king-of-fighters-96-sega-saturn-screenshot-tough-man-talk.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="The King of Fighters '97">					<description>The King of Fighters '97</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fkof97%2Fthe%20king%20of%20fighters%20%2797%20%28doukonban%29%20%28t-3120g%29.chd" size="332922938"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>SNK</studio>					<plot>Another year, another KOF.

In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed &amp;quot;Krazy Ivan&amp;quot;. He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.The player controls Ivan's &amp;quot;Steel Cossack&amp;quot; power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn.

The story centers around the creation of a holy sword named Langrisser, and the first Descendants of Light, the only people who can wield it. The main character is the knight Diharuto, the ancestor of Leon (Elwin's rival in &amp;quot;Langrisser II&amp;quot;). He must defeat the evil Boser, who is bound to the evil sword Alhazzard.In Langrisser III, you don't control whole armies, but only their generals, whom you move around the battle field. Once two enemy generals meet each other, a 3D battle sequence occurs, during which the two armies fight; the outcome of the battle is decided only by the victory or defeat of the general. The game also features love simulation elements: depending on the main hero's responses to various female characters, you can raise their &amp;quot;love level&amp;quot;.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG), Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/58607-langrisser-iii-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/251371-langrisser-iii-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/58608-langrisser-iii-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/58609-langrisser-iii-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>			</game>			<game name="Langrisser IV (Jpn)">					<description>Langrisser IV (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Flang4%2Flangrisser%20iv%20%28satakore%29%20%28t-2512g%29.chd" size="414189389"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>NCS</studio>					<plot>Langrisser IV is the fourth in the long-running Japanese strategy RPG series.Cleons, the king of the country Regenburg, offers his general Gizarov a reward for his achievements on the battle field. For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion...The game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two Langrisser games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to Ultima games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own &amp;quot;judgment&amp;quot; ability&amp;quot;; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG), Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/58612-langrisser-iv-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/58613-langrisser-iv-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/58614-langrisser-iv-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="Langrisser V - The End of Legend (Jpn)">					<description>Langrisser V - The End of Legend (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Flang5%2Flangrisser%20v%20-%20the%20end%20of%20legend%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0558%29.chd" size="353962796"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>NCS</studio>					<plot>Join Leon in his journey to banish Agito, gain control of the Silver Amulet, and become the next Spirit King of Oasis.

However, the Saturn version comes with a few extras, in-game as well as in the packaging.In addition to the new difficulty levels and mission objectives introduced in the Playstation remake, there are more statistics and battle objectives, which can be selected directly from the main menu and then set on the difficulty/mission selection screen. The game then keeps track of these battle records, similarly to the way it registers the amount of captured animals and other mission objectives.Packaging-wise, the game comes with an additional CD which contains the game's soundtrack.

These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated. Enemies turn &quot;angry&quot;  becoming pink-colored and moving faster  if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, but disappear once a player's life is lost.

While the game is in 3D, the game play resembles early 2D platformers in which you generically either go left or right, limiting the mobility of each character.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6280-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6280-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/70046-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/117913-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6280-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/70047-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/70089-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/117914-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/117915-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/519910-the-lost-world-jurassic-park-sega-saturn-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/6280.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Lovely Pop 2 in 1 Jan Jan Koi Shimasho (Jpn)">					<description>Lovely Pop 2 in 1 Jan Jan Koi Shimasho (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Flovpop%2Flovely%20pop%202%20in%201%20jan%20jan%20koi%20shimasho%20%28j%29%20%28t-5801g%29.chd" size="245154778"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Visco</studio>					<plot>The dinosaurs are back in this monstrous sequel.

As the player expands the castle, by placing more structures, it spawns additional mana-collecting balloons and armed guards that defend it against attacks by enemy wizards.

The Clans are invading the Inner Sphere. Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the &quot;par&quot; force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>03/31/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9259-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9259-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9259.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Media ROMancer Daisuke Asakura (Jpn)">					<description>Media ROMancer Daisuke Asakura (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fmediarom%2Fmedia%20romancer%20daisuke%20asakura%20%28t-25001g%29.chd" size="263942944"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Fun House</studio>					<plot>Maximum Force is the follow up to Area 51, however, this time around instead of shooting up aliens, the player goes up against a terrorist organization.The gameplay is similar to other first-person shooter gun games where the player can use a light gun or a controller to shoot at bad guys popping up from behind objects or coming off from the side of the screen.

The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<releasedate>03/28/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11302-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11302-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71772-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11302-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163392-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71773-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74928-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414011-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-story.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414012-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-options.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414013-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-choose-your-fighter.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414014-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-climbing-the-mountain.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414016-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-uppercut-during-shadow.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414017-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-explosive-move.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414018-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-devastating-punch.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414019-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-kitana-is-not-a-fan.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414020-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-non-scorching-fireball.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/414021-mortal-kombat-ii-sega-saturn-screenshot-frozen-in-mid-air.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11302.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Mainichi Kawaru Quizbangumi Quiz365 (Jpn)">					<description>Mainichi Kawaru Quizbangumi Quiz365 (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fmkq365%2Fmainichi%20kawaru%20quizbangumi%20quiz365%20%28j%29%20%28t-21201g%29.chd" size="6594533"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>OZ Club</studio>					<plot>The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player.

To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>02/28/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7809-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7809-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71733-mortal-kombat-trilogy-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7809-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71734-mortal-kombat-trilogy-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74925-mortal-kombat-trilogy-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7809.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Mouri Motonari - Chikai no Sanshi (Jpn)">					<description>Mouri Motonari - Chikai no Sanshi (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fmourimot%2Fmouri%20motonari%20-%20chikai%20no%20sanshi%20%28t-7646g%29.chd" size="192465070"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Koei</studio>					<plot>All the characters from the first three Mortal Kombat games return for the ultimate battle.

He invented a special set of drums using science and alchemy, allowing him to control a power called &amp;quot;skeletism&amp;quot;. By using this power, DaGoulian reanimates the dead, raising people's skeletons from their graves and building a fearsome army to fulfill his mad plan. However, one of these skeletons had been a person of a particularly pure heart, and instead of being afflicted with the red (evil) skeletism, he is reanimated with its blue version, allowing him to retain his free will and refuse the madman's orders. DaGoulian orders his minions to get rid of this rebel, who has to fight for his life and eventually figure a way to stop the insanity.Mr. Bones is an action game that consists of numerous stages. With the exception of a few, each stage has a different goal and introduces unique gameplay style. The stages also vary greatly in length, some being extended platform levels and others consisting of short timed sequences. Many of the stages involve avoiding hazards or enemies, as well as tasks that must be completed within a certain time limit. Mr. Bones, the skeletal protagonist of the game, usually has no offensive arsenal. When damaged, he begins to lose limbs and bones, which affects his manoeuvrability and speed; he may even end up with nothing but a head and a neck hopping on the ground.Some of the stages are simple one-screen arcade levels, while others may deviate from the action-oriented gameplay (e.g. a stage during which the player has to combine sentences into jokes to get past guards). A few stages involve music exercises, for example a level that requires Mr. Bones to play blues guitar to impress a skeleton crowd. Another stage is a paddle game variant in which a small Mr. Bones bounces off a giant head of himself, trying to collect his own bones. In another level the hero must protect a village of tiny people against enemy assault.The story is advanced by video cutscenes displayed between the levels. Some of these are computer-generated, while others utilize footage of live actors, or a mixture of both.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71369-mr-bones-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/101640-mr-bones-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/199200-mr-bones-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71371-mr-bones-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/71373-mr-bones-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/101641-mr-bones-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/101642-mr-bones-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/101643-mr-bones-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/199201-mr-bones-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205085-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205086-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-most-levels-of-mr-bones-greatly.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205087-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-sucking-the-life-out-of-the.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205088-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-platform-stages-our-undead.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205089-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-game-uses-lots-and-lots.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205090-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-as-well-as-some-live-action.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205092-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-this-stage-you-have-to.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205094-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-level-names-are-announced.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205095-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-stage-5-levels-get-longer.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205096-mr-bones-sega-saturn-screenshot-it-s-game-over-mr-bones-turns.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Mr. Bones (USA) Disc 2">					<description>Mr. Bones (USA) Disc 2</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fmrbones%2Fsat-0760-mr_bones-usa-cd2.chd" size="351381169"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>A philosopher named DaGoulian came up with a dubious doctrine: he believes that the only way to ensure the survival of the good is by making the world more evil.

The aim of the game is to use attacks and special abilities to knock out your opponent, or possess more life than him/her at the end of the round. Throughout the match, players build up a super meter which can be used to perform powerful Infinity Combo attacks. A unique mechanic in the game are the Infinity Gems; Power, Time, Space, Reality, Soul and Mind. These gems can be earned by obtaining them from opponents during arcade mode, or by fulfilling certain criteria during versus mode, such as getting the first hit. By using these gems in battle, fighters receive enhanced effects for a short amount of time, such as increased power or defense, health recovery or additional attacks. Also, certain fighters will receive extra benefits whilst using certain gems. For example, if Spider-Man uses the Power gem, he can create a doppelganger on the opposite side of his opponent for extra damage during his attacks.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<releasedate>09/30/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11296-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11296-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11296-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11296-4.jpg</fanart4>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11296-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26800-marvel-super-heroes-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48158-marvel-super-heroes-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/131299-marvel-super-heroes-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11296-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45689-marvel-super-heroes-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45690-marvel-super-heroes-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/131300-marvel-super-heroes-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/131301-marvel-super-heroes-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11296.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter">					<description>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fmshvssf%2Fmarvel%20super%20heroes%20vs%20street%20fighter%20%28t-1239g%29.chd" size="357548961"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Capcom</studio>					<plot>Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter is a 2D fighting game and the first to combine characters from Capcom's Street Fighter series with those of the Marvel comic universe. It is also the first in Capcom's games to introduce a tag team style of combat where the player can call for another character during a fight.Matches consists of two-on-two battles where the player can only control one character at a time. The other character can be called in regularly or while doing an attack. The off-screen one also regains some health while waiting. Both opposing characters need to be defeated to win the match, and when one dies the other is called in automatically. The tag team options introduces Variable Attack, Variable Counter and Variable Combination where the two characters team up to attack, counter of perform a special move.Most of the X-Men characters were already present in X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes: Cyclops, Storm, Juggernaut, Magneto and Wolverine, with the addition of Rogue, Gambit and Sabretooth. The Street Fighter characters are gathered from Street Fighter Alpha 2: Ryu, Ken, Cammy/Chun-Li, Charlie, Zangief, Dhalsim, M. Bison and Akuma. The final boss of the game is Apocalypse.The PlayStation version does not include the tag team feature and relies on the more traditional best-two-of-three round setup.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31099-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15989-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15990-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15991-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15992-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart5>			</game>			<game name="Monster Slider (Jpn)">					<description>Monster Slider (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fmslider%2Fmonster%20slider%20%28japan%29.chd" size="131384732"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>DATT Japan</studio>					<plot>European release</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11245-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15989-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11245-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15990-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15991-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15992-marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart6>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11245.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (Jpn)">					<description>Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fmslug%2Fdoukonban%20~%20metal%20slug%20%28jpn%29%20%28v1.002%29%20%28dw0073%29.chd" size="351703307"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>SNK</studio>					<plot>Metal Slug, originally released on the Neo Geo, is a side-scrolling shoot'em'up.The player(s) takes the role of a soldier (or two) and fights a gigantic army.

Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories, from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover.

Some examples are instant &amp;quot;on-fire,&amp;quot; enhanced 3-point accuracy, monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other players to the ground.&amp;quot;Juice Mode&amp;quot; increases the speed of the game up to 4x.&amp;quot;Tournament Mode&amp;quot; disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher CPU difficulty level.</plot>					<genre>Action, Sports</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/6827-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/6827-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35794-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/286536-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/6827-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35795-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/130689-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/286537-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/167441-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404332-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404333-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-publisher.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404334-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-publisher.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404335-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404336-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-birth-date.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404337-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-team-selection.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404338-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-match.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404339-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-tip-off.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404340-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-getting.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/404341-nba-jam-tournament-edition-sega-saturn-screenshot-coaching.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/6827-g.png</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/6827.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="NBA Live 97 (USA)">					<description>NBA Live 97 (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fnbaliv97%2Fsat-0663-nba_live_97-usa.chd" size="236362078"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Electronic Arts</studio>					<plot>NBA Live 97 is a basketball game with an emphasis on realism.

Your actions in the game are determined by the roll of dice. It will tell you at what time of the week you'll be able to begin your turn, how many steps you take on the world map, how much damage you do in battles, and so on.

The area is populated by mutant animals called &quot;khourieats&quot;. The town inhabitants see them as bad omens and kill them. One day Lundi finds a small khourieat with wings. Instead of killing it, Lundi decides to hide it and keep it as a pet. After his town was destroyed by an ancient weapon, Lundi sets out on a long journey with his pet, who will soon become a powerful dragon.Like the first game, Panzer Dragoon Zwei is a rail-shooter. The player follows a pre-set course and either uses Lundi's gun or the dragon's special abilities to dispose of the enemies. Lagi (that is the name of the dragon) can evolve during the game and gain more powerful attacks, which signifies a step towards a real RPG like Panzer Dragoon Saga.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>03/22/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9261-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9261-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9261-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9261-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9261-5.jpg</fanart5>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9261-2.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/50865-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35733-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/68102-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/107926-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/9261-2.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/50866-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/50867-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35734-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52040-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285074-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285075-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-options-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285076-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-opening-story.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285077-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-seeing-the-big.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285078-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-levels-drop.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285079-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-taking-on-the.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285080-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-blowing-stuff.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285081-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-big-ship.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285082-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-there-s-the.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/285083-panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-rather-fearsome.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/9261-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9261.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Panzer Dragoon Saga Disc 1">					<description>Panzer Dragoon Saga Disc 1</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fpanzsaga%2Fpanzer%20dragoon%20saga%20%28disc%201%29%20%28sat%29%20%28u%29-redump.chd" size="399149124"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Edge is one of the soldiers in the service of the mighty Empire.

Edge moves around through the game's fully 3D world by riding the dragon. In towns and some dungeons Edge can also move on foot. During battles, the player can either choose to shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of the dragons.

The Empire has recently ordered some excavations at ancient ruins, trying to discover the secret of an old technology that is much superior to that of present time. During the excavation works, Edge encounters a mysterious young girl. He then witnesses the murder of his captain and other soldiers by Crayden, one of the Empire's officers. Coming into contact with an ancient dragon, Edge begins to roam the world, determined to find Crayden and avenge the death of his comrades. Nobody helps him but his faithful dragon. But the Empire is also after Crayden, so there appear to be at least three sides in the conflict - or are there more?Panzer Dragoon Saga is set in the same universe as the other Panzer Dragoon games, but differs from the rest of the series by being a role-playing game with elements of a shooter. There is no party in the game: the player only controls Edge on the back of his dragon, who is in fact the playable character in battles. Edge moves around through the game's fully 3D world by riding the dragon. In towns and some dungeons Edge can also move on foot. During battles, the player can either choose to shoot with Edge's gun, or use one of the many special attacks of the dragons. The battles do not work exactly like in an action game, but occur in real time: the player has to quickly choose an ability to use, and also move around to attack enemies from the sides or from the back, at the same time trying to avoid their attacks. The dragon receives experience points for fighting and also gains levels. The player is able to customize the dragon by assigning to him one of the four available dragon classes, that will determine his attack power, speed, etc.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/216824-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74771-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74858-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74860-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28720-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205680-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205681-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205682-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205683-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205684-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281325-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281324-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-intro-is-exceptionally.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281326-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-close-up-on-edge.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281327-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-very-mysterious.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281328-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-azel-appears-for.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281329-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-starting-location.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281330-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-once-the-camera.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281331-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-most-of-the-locations.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281332-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-dragon-can.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281333-panzer-dragoon-saga-sega-saturn-screenshot-viewing-the-area.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Parodius (Euro)">					<description>Parodius (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fparodius%2F0101-paro-eur.chd" size="409249818"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<plot>This compilation collects the first two arcade incarnations of Konami's shoot'em'up parody series on one disc: Parodius Da!

He intends to have a cool summer vacation, but realizes he has no money. Having no choice, he takes a job in his father's restaurant, &amp;quot;Pia Carrot&amp;quot;. Thus begins an adventure much more exciting than the summer vacation he has dreamed about: he gets to know many beautiful girls in the restaurant, and has to decide which one is the love of his life...The game is a true dating simulation, with the gameplay focusing on making schedules and choosing activities for the protagonist. In the beginning of each day, the player typically choose an action before it's time to go to work. These actions range from giving a call to any of the girls the hero meets during the game, going to different locations, simply resting, etc. While at work, the player should make a schedule for Yusuke, sending him to work in different places (kitchen, basement, counter, etc.). After work, it's time to choose which girl to talk to. There are also many events that prompt the player to choose an action or a conversation option.All these actions influence Yusuke's statistics, ultimately making him more (or less) attractive to the various girls he meets on his path.

Thus begins an adventure much more exciting than the summer vacation he has dreamed about: he gets to know many beautiful girls in the restaurant, and has to decide which one is the love of his life...The game is a true dating simulation, with the gameplay focusing on making schedules and choosing activities for the protagonist. In the beginning of each day, the player typically choose an action before it's time to go to work. These actions range from giving a call to any of the girls the hero meets during the game, going to different locations, simply resting, etc. While at work, the player should make a schedule for Yusuke, sending him to work in different places (kitchen, basement, counter, etc.). After work, it's time to choose which girl to talk to. There are also many events that prompt the player to choose an action or a conversation option.All these actions influence Yusuke's statistics, ultimately making him more (or less) attractive to the various girls he meets on his path.

These actions range from giving a call to any of the girls the hero meets during the game, going to different locations, simply resting, etc. While at work, the player should make a schedule for Yusuke, sending him to work in different places (kitchen, basement, counter, etc.). After work, it's time to choose which girl to talk to. There are also many events that prompt the player to choose an action or a conversation option.All these actions influence Yusuke's statistics, ultimately making him more (or less) attractive to the various girls he meets on his path. Depending on the way the player shapes and schedules the activities of the main character, he will follow one of the many different narratives, meet different people, and eventually - if the player is persistent enough - win the heart of the girl he loves.The computer and the PC-FX versions feature scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</plot>					<genre>Simulation</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481266-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-nice-ram-question.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481267-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481268-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-here-you-can-view.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481269-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-nice-outfit-orange.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481270-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-i-ve-always-liked.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481271-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-family-scene.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481272-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-ahh-those-school.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481273-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-memories-memories.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481274-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-hero-s-room-tm.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481275-pia-carrot-e-yokoso-sega-saturn-screenshot-watch-how-your.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Private Idol Disc Vol. 5 - Fujisaki Nanako (Jpn)">					<description>Private Idol Disc Vol. 5 - Fujisaki Nanako (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fpidolv5%2Fprivate%20idol%20disc%20vol%205%20-%20fujisaki%20nanako%20%28t-30811g%29.chd" size="352667210"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Sada Soft Genki</studio>					<plot>In Pia Carrot e Ykoso!!, the player controls Yusuke Kinoshita, a 18-year-old male Japanese high-school student.

The backgrounds are digitized photos of real locations in Japan, while the characters are hand-drawn anime style pictures.</plot>					<genre>Simulation</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/277934-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/277935-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/277937-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/277938-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/277936-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481236-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481237-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-memories-memories.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481238-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-and-the-sweet.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481239-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-map-of-japan-travel.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481240-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-you-can-travel.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481241-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-yokohama-the-city.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481242-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-nice-photos-lots.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481243-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-your-order-sir.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481244-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-you-can-also-travel.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/481245-sentimental-graffiti-sega-saturn-screenshot-or-by-boat-romantic.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Pocket Fighter (Jpn)">					<description>Pocket Fighter (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fpocketfi%2Fpocket%20fighter%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0021%29.chd" size="450857333"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Capcom</studio>					<plot>What happens when you take several signature Capcom fighters, squish them down into chibi (small or SD) versions of themselves, and give them a whole collection of wacky moves and over-the-top costumes?

Three years later the founders of the colony felt it needed to be protected, and chose five best policemen from Earth to do that: Gates Becker from Scotland Yard, the Japanese Sadaoki Tokugawa, Salvatore Toscanini from New York, and two policemen from Los Angeles: Jonathan Ingram and his best friend Ed Brown. During a routine patrol on Beyond Coast, something happened to Jonathan's space suit. He was sucked into space and presumed dead. Twenty-five years later, he is miraculously discovered in his life pod, alive. He still looks like a young man, but in reality he is fifty-five years old.Trying to forget his past, Jonathan opens an investigation agency on Earth. One day, his ex-wife unexpectedly pays him a visit. She has re-married during Jonathan's prolonged absence, and asks him to find her missing husband. When she leaves the office, her car explodes, and she dies. Determined to fulfill her final request, Jonathan prepares to re-visit Beyond Coast.Policenauts is a Japanese-style adventure with action elements, similar in many ways to Snatcher. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics. Action sequences are similar to those of Snatcher, but are more numerous and varied. The player must rapidly shoot enemies moving within a one-screen area viewed from a first-person perspective, reloading the gun manually and trying to eliminate the enemy before Jonathan's health bar is depleted. </plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45520-policenauts-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45521-policenauts-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45517-policenauts-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45518-policenauts-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45519-policenauts-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45512-policenauts-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45514-policenauts-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45516-policenauts-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45513-policenauts-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart9>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76778-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76779-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-jonathan-it-s-unlocked-come.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76780-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-jonathan-redwood-inside.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76781-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-cop-it-s-an-acronym-for.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76782-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-masked-bomber.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76783-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-ed-jonathan-jonathan-ingram.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76784-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-meryl-no-it-s-a-paint-tattoo.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76799-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-victor-hey-aren-t-you-ingram.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76800-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-gatse-tokugawa-left-the.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76830-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-chris-goldwin-the-director.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Policenauts (Jpn) Disc 2">					<description>Policenauts (Jpn) Disc 2</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fpolicena%2Fpolicenauts%20%28disc%202%20of%203%29%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0319%29.chd" size="394190380"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<plot>In the year 2010 mankind has built its first space colony, Beyond Coast.

The gameplay is stylistically very similar to the Gradius series, but the graphics and music are intentionally absurd. The game, as its name would suggest (translated: &quot;Chatting Parodius Live&quot;), contains a large amount of Japanese voice samples shouted out in a style similar to that of a game show host.Unlike the previous titles, this game was not created originally as an Arcade game. Instead, it was originally released on the japanese Super Famicom and this port is an upgraded version of that one, featuring not only improved graphics and sound from the Super Famicom game, but some altered levels and bosses, including a cheat to replace &quot;Tokimeki People's Dance&quot; with an enhanced version, &quot;Days Of The Dream's Memories&quot;. Also added were several &quot;Omake&quot; stages and an unlockable Dracula-kun and Kid Dracula as a playable character. In a two-player game, both players can now choose to play simultaneously instead of just alternately in the Super Famicom game.This game was also released on the Sony PlayStation with little differences compared to this version.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<releasedate>12/13/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/25570-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45520-policenauts-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/25570-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45521-policenauts-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45517-policenauts-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45518-policenauts-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45519-policenauts-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45512-policenauts-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45514-policenauts-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/45516-policenauts-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76778-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76779-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-jonathan-it-s-unlocked-come.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76780-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-jonathan-redwood-inside.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76781-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-cop-it-s-an-acronym-for.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76782-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-masked-bomber.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76783-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-ed-jonathan-jonathan-ingram.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76784-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-meryl-no-it-s-a-paint-tattoo.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76799-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-victor-hey-aren-t-you-ingram.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76800-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-gatse-tokugawa-left-the.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/76830-policenauts-sega-saturn-screenshot-chris-goldwin-the-director.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Princess Crown (Jpn)">					<description>Princess Crown (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fprcrown%2Fprincess%20crown%20%28japan%29.chd" size="386994403"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<plot>You play as the thirteen-year-old princess Gradriel, the daughter of Elfrenne, queen of Valendria. Twenty-five years ago Elfrenne destroyed the demonic forces that were threatening the country. Now the queen has died, and Gradriel is proclaimed to be the future savior of the land, as it was not entirely purged of all evil. And indeed, an evil spirit has secretly invaded Valendria and is trying to take control over Gradriel's two older sisters. Will the young princess succeed in defeating the evil?This is an action/platform RPG, somewhat similar to the third game in  Ys series. The entire game world is a side-scrolling platform on which fights, exploration, and conversation with the NPCs take place. The combat is detailed and contains elements of fighting games. Although the princess develops like a RPG protagonist, she can also use various physical moves in combat: kick, dash, defend, crouch, etc. </plot>					<genre>Action, Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/23754-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79794-princess-crown-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189710-princess-crown-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79793-princess-crown-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/79795-princess-crown-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189712-princess-crown-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189711-princess-crown-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205169-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205170-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-gradriel-in-the-opening.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205171-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-how-about-a-side-scrolling.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205172-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-elite-knights-battling.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205173-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-did-i-mention-that-this.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205174-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-gradriel-in-town-with.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205175-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-talk-to-the-sword-little.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/205176-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-battle-parts-are.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/510274-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-fairy-distracts.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/510275-princess-crown-sega-saturn-screenshot-these-guys-apparently.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Seifuku Densetsu Pretty Fighter X (Jpn)">					<description>Seifuku Densetsu Pretty Fighter X (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fprettyx%2Fseifuku%20densetsu%20pretty%20fighter%20x%20%28t-15001g%29.chd" size="298525383"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Imagineer</studio>					<plot>X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a fighting game originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1996.

It was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998.

The evil Dark Prince has caused the sun to augment its size and power to dangerous levels, and thus the Puyo Puyo world is on the verge of being scorched unless you prevent it.The game features three distinct story campaigns, each pitting you against a different set of enemies which you must battle in classic Puyo Puyo fashion: In each stage you face off against an opponent in two different play areas, one for you and one for your opponent. As the blob-like &amp;quot;puyos&amp;quot; start falling in your play area, you must align them and create groups of the same color in order to clear the screen before you get flooded with puyos. Chaining puyos of different colors allows you to send several &amp;quot;garbage&amp;quot; puyos to the opposing player's play area in hopes of either flooding it, or slowing his advance, and whoever defeats the opposing player moves on to the next challenger.New for Puyo Puyo Sun are the Sun Puyos, which can be added to combos for extra damage. Also includes 2P vs gameplay, challenge modes and galleries and other bonus features.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220035-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220036-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220033-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220034-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645054-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-movie.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645055-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-movie.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645056-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-movie.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645057-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-movie.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645059-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645049-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-character-difficulty.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645052-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-before-each-match-a-dialog.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645053-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-game-play.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645060-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-victory.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/645048-puyo-puyo-sun-sega-saturn-screenshot-chains-that-include-sun.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Quarterback Attack (USA)">					<description>Quarterback Attack (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fqbattack%2Fquarterback%20attack%20v1.000%20%281995%29%28digital%20pictures%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="471000424"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Digital Pictures</studio>					<plot>In this semi-fmv game you play a rookie facing his first game as starting quarterback on a fictional team, and this just happens to be The Big Game.The entire game consists of this confrontation, upon start of the game you watch a video of a kickoff and return, and then you get to select among 110 plays (100 passing and 10 running) and assing a snap count.

Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs.

The story takes place in a summer of 1999, as a large explosion occurred in a General Hospital. Due to a deadly virus being released, the hospital is on lock-down, and you are left with no way out. The player assumes a role of Hajime who after going to visit your best friend, finds himself trapped in a hospital along with your two friends, Ryou and Tomowo, and a rookie nurse Aya. The gameplay consists of exploring locations in the hospital by moving in a certain direction (forward, turn left or right, or turn back) which uses pre-rendered animation for every movement from one point to another. Certain locations can be zoomed in to give you more details or to pick up an item. Your companions will often give you some comments while you explore, mostly of which may seem a selection of five sentences that are randomly selected. The game also features the use of player's senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste) which must be used at key locations and events in order to progress the game.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/299123-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/299124-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/299125-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/299126-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758659-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-splash-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758660-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758661-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-name-entry.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758662-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-hajime-the.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758663-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-introduction.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758664-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-seems-the.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758665-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-guess-tomowo.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758666-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-exploring.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758667-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-checking.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/758668-r-mj-the-mystery-hospital-sega-saturn-screenshot-there-s-no.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Road Blaster (Interactive Movie Action - Thunder Storm &amp; Road Blaster Disc 2) (Jpn)">					<description>Road Blaster (Interactive Movie Action - Thunder Storm &amp; Road Blaster Disc 2) (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Froadblst%2Finteractive%20movie%20action%20-%20thunder%20storm%20%26%20road%20blaster%20%28japan%29%20%28disc%202%29%20%28road%20blaster%29.chd" size="314630375"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Ecseco Development</studio>					<plot>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties.

Well, maybe not so simple. When you start your game, you have to build your mechanical gladiator; choosing the color, body, eyes and legs. While most of your starting choices are purely cosmetic, the legs you choose do slightly affect your game by changing the speed and mobility of your fighter, as well as its special attack.Once you've created your robotic brawler, it's time to start climbing the ranks. To progress, you have to fight the robot that's occupying the rank above yours. Once you beat them, you get to take an arm and then move up. The game continues on in this fashion until you've bested all of the other combatants. However, a few curve-balls are thrown your way as you climb the ladder. For starters, there are several different arms you can acquire; from swords and shields to cannons and lasers, and the more you use them, the faster and more effective (i.e. damaging) they are. On top of that, even so often a sort of &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; robot is put in your way. These &amp;quot;bosses&amp;quot; use special weapons that only they have access to. Until you pound them into scrap and take them, that is. These weapons can be incredibly powerful if you stick with them, making the rest of the fighters, save number one, a breeze. As an added bonus, you can even save your cyber-combatant to a memory card and bring it to a friend's house for some one-on-one let's-see-who-has-the-best-robot fighting goodness!The arenas themselves are fairly basic, but they are varied, offering up different layout and obstacles to take cover behind or use to get the drop on your opponent. They also have ledges, and like most fighting games a ring-out means an instant loss. As for the fighting, it's simple, but effective. Square and circle attack with the left and right arms, X jumps and triangle triggers your special (which has to charge of course). Of course different weapons have different ranges and timing, which will also improve the more you use them.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>06/01/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11325-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/81805-robo-pit-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163986-robo-pit-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11325-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/81804-robo-pit-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/81806-robo-pit-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163987-robo-pit-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163988-robo-pit-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212174-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212175-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212176-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212177-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-building-my-first-robot-kind.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212178-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-you-are-given-a-wide-selection.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212179-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-yes-it-s-alive-it-s-alive.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212180-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-closing-in-for-the-kill.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212181-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-robots-in-this-game-might.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212182-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-i-win.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212183-robo-pit-sega-saturn-screenshot-winning-tally-screen.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11325.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV - Wall of Fire (USA)">					<description>Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV - Wall of Fire (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Froman3k4%2Fsat-0857-romance_of_3_kingdoms_4-usa.chd" size="376124332"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Koei</studio>					<plot>It's the era of the Second Han Dynasty, and China is being overrun by powerful warlords.

All weapons are available from the start. Weapons can 'level up', however, becoming more powerful as the player uses them to score points. There are a selection of 7 weapons that can be used at any given time:The game is designed so that there is almost always a 'right' weapon for any situation. The bosses in the game are designed so that they have multiple 'sections' which, if all destroyed before the 'core' of the boss, will award the players with point bonuses. Being able to apply the right weapons on any different boss is key to obtaining these bonuses. For example, a boss may have two sections located on either side of the screen. You could immediately go up to one and begin shooting it with a vulcan, or you could hover in the centre and hit both at the same time with the side bombs. This would increase your chance of obtaining the bonus before the time limit runs out and the boss self-destructs.The game rewards players for &quot;chaining&quot; enemies of just one of three colors, red, blue, or yellow. Whenever the player kills three enemies that are of the same color, who can obtain a points bonus. This also facilitates faster upgrading of weapons.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>07/23/1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11320-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11320-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11320-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163237-radiant-silvergun-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11320-1.jpg</boxart3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11320.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Ruriiro no Yuki (Jpn, Shokai Genteiban)">					<description>Ruriiro no Yuki (Jpn, Shokai Genteiban)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_2%2Fruryuki%2Fruriiro%20no%20yuki%20%28shokai%20genteiban%29%20%28j%29%20%28t-19722g%29.chd" size="229724949"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>KID</studio>					<plot>The story of Radiant Silvergun begins with the end of the world.

In a twist on the legend of King Arthur, the player controls Flicker, who lives in Camelhot castle and is in love with Princess Flame, but is not eligible to ask for her hand in marriage because he is not a knight. However, the King has announced a dragon tournament, where the winner will not only win the princess but also become the new king. As a young Flicker, the player must collect various objects and interact with an eccentric cast of dragon and human characters in order to solve puzzles. The player's overall quest is to become a dragon knight to compete in the grand tournament and win the heart of Princess Flame. However, the player discovers an evil human plot to take over the kingdom by kidnapping the princess. As is the case with many other graphic adventure games, the player can never die in the game or reach a point in the game where a puzzle cannot be solved. The humour in the game is heavily influenced by the British comedy of Monty Python (the game starring former Monty Python actor Terry Jones) and thus includes plenty of mild sexual innuendos, and other shenanigans. While the video game leaves open the possibility for a sequel, no sequel for the game was planned.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>10/31/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7935-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7935-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/163237-radiant-silvergun-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7935-1.jpg</boxart3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7935.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Strikers 1945 (Jpn)">					<description>Strikers 1945 (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fs1945%2Fstrikers%201945%20%28japan%29.chd" size="103274375"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<plot>Strikers 1945, not to be confused with the US PSX game Strikers 1945, which is actually the sequel Strikers 1945 II, is a port of the top-down vertically-scrolling arcade shooter.

Technology is evolving, and the use of steam has made for great breakthroughs in transportation in weaponry. But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.And, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichiro Ogami's life is about to take a very interesting turn as the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ichiro now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects to keep things under control.The gameplay of Sakura Taisen is a combination of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, which serves as a disguise for the military base. Depending on the player's decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - the protagonist will develop different relationships with the girls, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also slightly affect their parameters in battles. During combat, the player navigates Ichiro and the girls over an isometric battlefield and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn it is possible to perform two different actions per character; walking distance and attack range are limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment in the game.</plot>					<genre>Adventure, Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34987-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34988-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34989-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281685-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281682-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-introducing-the-characters.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281683-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-complex-machinery-of.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281684-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-all-the-heroes-together.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281686-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-view-over-the-old-imperial.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281687-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-hero-oogami-ichirou.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281688-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-choose-your-answer-before.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281689-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-you-know-with-90-certainty.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281690-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-navigating-the-hero-in.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281691-sakura-taisen-sega-saturn-screenshot-you-meet-maria-for-the.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Sakura Taisen (Jpn) Disc 2">					<description>Sakura Taisen (Jpn) Disc 2</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsakurat%2Fsakura%20taisen%20%28satakore%29%20disc%202%20%28gs-9191%29.chd" size="390354314"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>The sequel to the original Sega Saturn system seller (in Japan at least) becomes one of the Saturn's last great hurrahs.

Aside from this the player is also thrown into battles at certain key points of the game, where the game switches to a static first person view in which the player has to kill whatever enemy or boss has crossed Rockman's path.In true Mega Man/Rockman fashion, Rockman absorbs the powers of any boss he defeats along the way, to be used against another boss later on in the game or any difficult enemies he encounters.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>			</game>			<game name="Saturn Bomberman">					<description>Saturn Bomberman</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsatbombm%2Fsaturn%20bomberman.chd" size="363266284"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>An all out party game, this Saturn exclusive title has you controlling the little blue bomber along with up to 10 other bomber pals planting bombs to trap enemy characters.Although there is no story mode, you can take on a host of other characters in one on one battles to see who is the master of the bomb. 10 players can then play on the one screen at a time, either against each other or in teams.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-10s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11326-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22809-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/200240-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205676-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11326-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22810-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/24909-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/200239-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205677-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205678-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400937-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400940-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400938-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-screenshot-our-first-destination.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400939-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-screenshot-first-level-in-story.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400941-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-screenshot-player-selection-battle.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400943-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-screenshot-selecting-battlefield.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400944-saturn-bomberman-sega-saturn-screenshot-and-finally-first.jpg</snapshot7>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11326.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Sega Saturn Choice Cuts (USA, v2.000)">					<description>Sega Saturn Choice Cuts (USA, v2.000)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsatccut%2Fsega_saturn_choice_cuts_v2_000-usa.chd" size="145577051"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>An all out party game, this Saturn exclusive title has you controlling the little blue bomber along with up to 10 other bomber pals planting bombs to trap enemy characters.

Based on the underground comic by Rob Schrab, Scuds are designed to self destruct after they have destroyed their target... Scud has become aware of this fact, and instead only injures his target enough to not self-destruct.  But, being a robot, Scud has no money, and must turn to freelance jobs to pay for his original target's life support.The game can be played with either a controller or the Virtua Stunner (or other compatible light gun).  With a controller, the game is a side scrolling shoot-em-up; but with a light gun, it becomes a first person shooter.  You can play with any combination of controllers and guns, but the game is essentially meant to be played with two guns (Scud himself uses two guns).The game is fueled by music from &amp;quot;DJR/IB3 LTD.&amp;quot; (Darryl J.

The Clans are invading the Inner Sphere. Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the &quot;par&quot; force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>03/31/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9259-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9259-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36413-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/70591-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/36415-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400956-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400957-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400958-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-settings.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400959-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-first.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400960-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-another.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400961-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-level.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400962-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-level.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/400963-scud-the-disposable-assassin-sega-saturn-screenshot-level.jpg</snapshot8>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/9259.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shin Megami Tensei - Devil Summoner (Jpn) (Rev A) Disc 1">					<description>Shin Megami Tensei - Devil Summoner (Jpn) (Rev A) Disc 1</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsdvsum%2Fshin%20megami%20tensei%20devil%20summoner%20special%20box%20disc%201%20%28t-14408g%29.chd" size="233813508"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<plot>A modern-day Japanese college student is about to go on a date with his girlfriend Kumiko, who has found a particularly interesting book about ancient Japanese history in the local library. On the way to the date the young man is attacked by demonic creatures and saved by the devil summoner Kyji Kuzunoha. Shortly thereafter, Kumiko is kidnapped by a mysterious man named Sid Davis, who hunts her boyfriend down and kills him. It appears that Kyji was killed as well, but the student's soul is miraculously transferred into his body. Taking Kyji's identity, the young man must now fill his place as a devil summoner, liberating the city from demons and locating Sid Davis in an attempt to rescue Kumiko.Devil Summoner continues the tradition of Megami Tensei games, being a role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling and communication with randomly encountered enemies. Unlike the main Shin Megami Tensei series, the game is set entirely in modern-day Japan. The player navigates the protagonist on an overhead city map, while individual locations are maze-like 3D dungeons explored from a first-person perspective. For the most part the player controls the main protagonist and his associate Rei, while the other four available slots of an active party can be occupied by summoned demons.Both human characters can use either swords or guns in battles, their efficiency depending on the particular enemy's weaknesses. Weapons as well as ammunition for guns can be bought in shops. Rei and many demons can also cast a variety of offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells. First-person combat is turn-based, with player-controlled characters positioned in two rows, which affects their attack and defense values. When the hero and Rei level up the player must manually raise their parameters, further customizing their combat performance.The player can avoid fighting randomly appearing enemies by opting to have a conversation with them. These conversations are more complex than in Shin Megami Tensei games, featuring a wider selection of dialogue choices. They may result in the demon joining the party or exchanging items, and their outcome depends on the demon's personality type and current moon phase as well. Demons consume a type of energy known as magnetite when summoned, which is gained from defeating enemies and can be exchanged for money and vice versa. Two or three demons can be fused in special locations to create more powerful ones. In addition, the game introduces a &amp;quot;loyalty&amp;quot; system: newly recruited demons have various degrees of loyalty, and might even disobey the player's orders in battles if their loyalty level is too low. Loyalty can be increased through various means, depending on the personality of the demon. Most demons would gradually become loyal when repeatedly summoned and taken to fight enemies.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28722-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168118-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28723-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28724-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168119-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168120-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168121-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281514-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281510-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-after.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281511-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-here.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281512-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-beautiful.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281513-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-at.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281515-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-a.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281516-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-your.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281517-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-accessing.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281518-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-yarai.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281519-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Shin Megami Tensei - Devil Summoner (Jpn) (Rev A) Disc 2">					<description>Shin Megami Tensei - Devil Summoner (Jpn) (Rev A) Disc 2</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsdvsum%2Fshin%20megami%20tensei%20devil%20summoner%20special%20box%20disc%202%20%28t-14408g%29.chd" size="78075498"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<plot>A modern-day Japanese college student is about to go on a date with his girlfriend Kumiko, who has found a particularly interesting book about ancient Japanese history in the local library.

For the most part the player controls the main protagonist and his associate Rei, while the other four available slots of an active party can be occupied by summoned demons.Both human characters can use either swords or guns in battles, their efficiency depending on the particular enemy's weaknesses. Weapons as well as ammunition for guns can be bought in shops. Rei and many demons can also cast a variety of offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells. First-person combat is turn-based, with player-controlled characters positioned in two rows, which affects their attack and defense values. When the hero and Rei level up the player must manually raise their parameters, further customizing their combat performance.The player can avoid fighting randomly appearing enemies by opting to have a conversation with them. These conversations are more complex than in Shin Megami Tensei games, featuring a wider selection of dialogue choices. They may result in the demon joining the party or exchanging items, and their outcome depends on the demon's personality type and current moon phase as well. Demons consume a type of energy known as magnetite when summoned, which is gained from defeating enemies and can be exchanged for money and vice versa. Two or three demons can be fused in special locations to create more powerful ones. In addition, the game introduces a &amp;quot;loyalty&amp;quot; system: newly recruited demons have various degrees of loyalty, and might even disobey the player's orders in battles if their loyalty level is too low. Loyalty can be increased through various means, depending on the personality of the demon. Most demons would gradually become loyal when repeatedly summoned and taken to fight enemies.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31360-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28722-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168118-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28723-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28724-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168119-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168120-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168121-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281514-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281510-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-after.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281511-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-here.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281512-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-beautiful.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281513-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-at.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281515-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-a.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281516-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-your.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281517-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-accessing.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281518-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-yarai.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281519-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="SeaBass Fishing (Euro)">					<description>SeaBass Fishing (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fseabass%2Fsea%20bass%20fishing%20%28e%29.chd" size="155699540"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>JVC</studio>					<plot>A modern-day Japanese college student is about to go on a date with his girlfriend Kumiko, who has found a particularly interesting book about ancient Japanese history in the local library.

Most demons would gradually become loyal when repeatedly summoned and taken to fight enemies.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>12/18/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11876-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28722-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168118-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11876-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28723-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/28724-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168119-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168120-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/168121-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281514-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281510-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-after.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281511-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-here.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281512-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-beautiful.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281513-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-at.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281515-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-a.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281516-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-your.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281517-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-accessing.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281518-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-yarai.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/281519-shin-megami-tensei-devil-summoner-sega-saturn-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Sega Screams Volume 1 (USA)">					<description>Sega Screams Volume 1 (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsegascre%2Fsega%20screams%20volume%201%20%28usa%29%20%28dw0279%29.chd" size="407602439"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Sega Ages: Volume 1 contains three games previously released in Japan as stand-alone titles;

Also, radio advertisements and other hidden bonuses have been included.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31333-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189804-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189805-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189806-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189807-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530378-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530379-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-screenshot-selection.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530380-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-screenshot-some-connection.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530381-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-screenshot-segata.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530382-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-screenshot-segata.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530383-segata-sanshiro-shinkenyugi-sega-saturn-screenshot-facing.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="Sentimental Graffiti (Jpn) Disc 1">					<description>Sentimental Graffiti (Jpn) Disc 1</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsentg%2Fsentimental%20graffiti%20disc%201%20%28t-20106g%29.chd" size="488096052"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>NEC Interchannel</studio>					<plot>The protagonist of the game is a Japanese high school student, who was frequently transferred from school to school in various cities of Japan.

Instead of just playing through each level and destroying enemies while avoiding getting hit, the player must also complete a special mission for each stage as well. Some of these missions range from collecting a certain amount of coins in a stage to destroying a certain object or enemies. Depending whether or not the player completes the mission will determine whether the player can continue to the next stage or what the next stage will be. Unlike the past versions, home ports of the game (exception of the PSP version) has cooperative multiplayer intact (where both players play simultaneously). It's also improved in that the game continues to play even when one player is choosing a character upon continuing.In a 2-player game, when certain characters are near enough, a third-shot appears between them which can be purple shots that swirl all-over the screen, hearts that home in on enemies, or rockets that shoot straight ahead. This feature was first seen on Konami's arcade game Trigon.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<releasedate>11/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/17648-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/17648-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17648-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/50516-sexy-parodius-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/17648-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/50517-sexy-parodius-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/50518-sexy-parodius-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart5>			</game>			<game name="Street Fighter 2 (Street Fighter Collection Disc 1) (Euro)">					<description>Street Fighter 2 (Street Fighter Collection Disc 1) (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsf2%2Fstreet_fighter_collection.chd" size="427877325"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Capcom</studio>					<plot>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series.New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves.

The game uses digitized animation based on the actors and the many locations featured in the film.Also included is a story mode which follows the story of the movie and uses FMV in-between fights and a Trial Battle Mode, where the player takes on Guile in a range of different battle events to test their skills.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/129205-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147670-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/129206-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51306-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147672-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147671-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/274922-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-movie.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/274923-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/274924-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-screenshot-fighter-selection.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/274925-street-fighter-the-movie-sega-saturn-screenshot-blanka-s-electric.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Street Fighter II Movie Disc 2">					<description>Street Fighter II Movie Disc 2</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsf2mov%2Fstreet%20fighter%202%20movie%20disc2%20%28t-1204g%29.chd" size="334072649"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Capcom</studio>					<plot>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series.New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves.

FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being &amp;quot;convinced&amp;quot; to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO's CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times. In post 3DO releases, only two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). The 3DO release contained several more, like a TV style fly-by-cam, weapon cameras, and enemy cams that could show a nearby enemies' POV. By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.One of the defining features of the game is using the laser (basic weapon) to terraform the map. As the game map is composed by tiles, some with higher or lower vertexes, can be leveled by simply firing repeatedly at the same area. This allows players to strategically avoid heavy defense turrets by simply collapsing a hill, or destroy an heavier turret by simply burrowing the ground beneath it.The player starts the game with three lives, and earns one every 250k points. Losing all lives means a game over, but as there isn't a profile for each pilot (like in Tie Fighter), the game can be resumed freely from the last savegame. </plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147683-starfighter-3000-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147684-starfighter-3000-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164122-starfighter-3000-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams (USA)">					<description>Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsfa%2Fstreet%20fighter%20alpha%20-%20warrior%27s%20dreams%20v1.000%20%281995%29%28capcom%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="396417949"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Virgin Interactive</studio>					<plot>It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters.

Although loyal to his father and his country, he senses that there are other forces at work beneath the tensions between Aspinia and Destonia. He attends the conference in Saraband on behalf of Destonia, along with his brothers Arrawnt and Mageron. As discovered in Scenario 1, much of this influence comes from the Bulzome sect, as well as collaborating separatist factions within both Destonia and Aspinia. Medion works parallel to Synbios of Aspinia, often disposing of rogue Aspinian elements to spare Synbios's force from fighting against its own countrymen. At the end of the game, Medion is forced to battle with Synbios' force when Julian steps in to stop them.</plot>					<genre>Role-PlayingStrategy</genre>					<releasedate>04/29/1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11177-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11177-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11177-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11177-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34924-shining-force-iii-scenario-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11177-1.jpg</boxart3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11177.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shining Force III - Scenario 3 - Hyouheki no Jashinguu (Jpn)">					<description>Shining Force III - Scenario 3 - Hyouheki no Jashinguu (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fshinf3s3%2Fshining%20force%20iii%20-%20scenario%203%20-%20hyouheki%20no%20jashinguu%20%28japan%29.chd" size="302391018"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Scenario 3, Bulzome Rising, stars Julian, a mercenary who appears as a secondary character in both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. He is for all intents and purposes the true main character of Shining Force III. His initial motivation as the story begins is to track down and kill Galm, one of, if not the, most powerful member of the Vandals, a powerful race of beings that existed over 1,000 years ago. Julian believes that Galm killed his father and is seeking revenge. This story arc is first introduced in an earlier Shining game, Shining the Holy Ark, in which Julian appears as a young boy who asks the party to search for his missing father.Julian joins Synbios in the midst of his quest in Scenario 1, but after an encounter with Galm, he is tossed over a waterfall at the suspension bridge and believed by Synbios' army to be dead. He reappears in Scenario 2, apparently washing ashore at the site of a battle between Medion's army and the Bulzome Sect. Knowing the sect's ties to the Vandals, Julian agrees to fight alongside Medion. As it becomes clear that the sect is trying to kill Gracia, a child intended to become the next Innovator (A Shining Series figure equatable to a god), Julian takes on the task of protecting him and helping him realize his destiny.Scenario 3 starts about 60% through scenario 2's story, and focuses primarily on battles against the Bulzome Sect and their allies in both Aspinia and Destonia. While scenarios 1 &amp; 2 happen at roughly the same time, much of scenario 3 takes place after both, but there is some &quot;overlap&quot;. Eventually Julian leads a three-party coalition consisting of the armies of both Synbios and Medion, to engage in the final conflict against Bulzome, a powerful Vandal long sealed in another dimension, and the true orchestrator of the conflict.</plot>					<genre>Role-PlayingStrategy</genre>					<releasedate>09/23/1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11178-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/11178-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11178-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/34925-shining-force-iii-scenario-3-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11178-1.jpg</boxart3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11178.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shining Force III (Euro)">					<description>Shining Force III (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fshinfrc3%2Fshining%20force%20iii%20-%20scenario%201%20%28sat%29%20%28u%29-redump.chd" size="138958687"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Scenario 1, God Warrior of the Kingdom, features Synbios, a young general from the Republic of Aspinia. Aspinia was once a part of the Empire of Destonia, but seceded after a war of independence spearheaded by some of the more democratic-minded nobles. They opposed Emperor Domaric's totalitarian policies, which disenfranchised a large number of people, creating a huge disparity between the wealthy and the poor. Tensions remained between Aspinia and Destonia after the secession, marked by occasional border disputes.As the game begins, Synbios is part of a military force representing Aspinia at a peace conference in the neutral city of Saraband. Due to manipulation by outside forces - later discovered to be connected with a religious cult known as the &quot;Bulzome Sect&quot; - full-scale war breaks out again between Aspinia and Destonia. The majority of the game's storyline covers this conflict as well as Synbios and his team's fight against the Bulzome sect. Throughout the game Synbios has periodic encounters with Medion, Destonia's youngest prince, who also recognizes the truth behind the war. Although on opposite sides of the war, the two work together to identify the real threat.</plot>					<genre>Role-PlayingStrategy</genre>					<releasedate>08/12/1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/185-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/185-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/185-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/185-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35738-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75337-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/97231-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/185-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35739-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75338-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75340-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75341-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75339-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155684-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen-of-the.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155685-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-burning-castle.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155686-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-on-the-battle-map.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155687-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-typical-shining.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155688-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-save-menu.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155689-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-an-enemy-emerges.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155690-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-it-s-the-opponent.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155691-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-back-attack-is.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155692-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-big-polygonal.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/155693-shining-force-iii-sega-saturn-screenshot-deflecting-fire-with.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/185.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shining the Holy Ark">					<description>Shining the Holy Ark</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fshinholy%2Fshining%20the%20holy%20ark%20%28sat%29%20%28u%29.chd" size="156423650"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>As the capable mercenary Arthur, you must summon every ounce of your role-playing prowess and lead your comrades on a do-or-die hunt for the kingdom's sacred artifacts.

The game proceeds by collecting various items found in dungeons and then combining them with magical orbs to create different spell effects that can be used to tackle enemies and solve the riddles that must be bested to beat each labyrinth. </plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54858-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75333-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/171192-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54860-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54859-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75334-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75336-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75335-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/109903-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/171193-shining-wisdom-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>			</game>			<game name="Shockwave Assault (USA)">					<description>Shockwave Assault (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fshockwav%2Fsat-0739-shockwave_assault-usa.chd" size="451923080"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Electronic Arts</studio>					<plot>Shockwave Assault combines Shock Wave and its expansion Operation Jumpgate and makes them available for systems other than the 3DO for the first time.In Shock Wave, the player takes the role of a rookie pilot, defending the Earth from an alien invasion.

Two attributes emerged from the ruins, known as Silhouette and Mirage; like Yin and Yang, they cannot exist without each other, but are fundamentally opposed in their nature and ideology. Only a Messenger, one who contains both attributes in a balance, is able to get to the Edo facility and reverse back the genetic disaster, destroying both Silhouette and Mirage. This messenger is a young girl named Shyna Nera Shyna.Silhouette Mirage is a side-scrolling action game. The basic gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Gunstar Heroes. The game's standout feature is the concept of the two attributes. Depending on the enemy's attributes and the type of attack used by Shyna, damage can be increased, and spirit (equivalent to magic power) can be absorbed from enemies. Shyna can dash, jump, crouch, slide, and grab enemies, executing combo attacks. It is also possible to master moves, acquire money, and purchase special creatures called &amp;quot;parasites&amp;quot;, which teach Shyna various types of attacks.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77931-silhouette-mirage-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77930-silhouette-mirage-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/77932-silhouette-mirage-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>			</game>			<game name="Sim City 2000 (USA)">					<description>Sim City 2000 (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsimcit2k%2Fsimcity%202000%20v1.401%20%281995%29%28maxis%29%28ntsc%29%28us%29%5B%21%5D.chd" size="65934581"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>SimCity 2000 is the successor to the city simulation game Sim City.

Only a few months after the events of Slayers Royal and already Lina, Gourry, and an even larger cast of characters will have to save the world yet again. If they don't all kill each other first, of course.Slayers Royal 2 plays similarly to the first game, but with several tweaks. You can no longer look at any object on a town screen, but there is now an event button that will automatically talk to anyone on the screen you're able to talk to. The passage of days from the first game has been expanded to include five times of day, and some events only happen at specific times. In combat the automatic turn system from the first game has been replaced with a more traditional one turn at a time. Terrain now has variable height, and can be raised or lowered with specific spells. Finally a spell's wait time is now reflected in the time it takes a character to cast a spell, making it possible to avoid a spell or attack a caster to prevent the spell from finishing.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/191453-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/251373-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/191454-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/191455-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/191456-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/608276-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/608277-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/608278-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-town.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/608279-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-map.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/608280-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-cutscene.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/608281-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-battle.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/608282-slayers-royal-2-sega-saturn-screenshot-spell-effects.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="Slayers Royal (Jpn)">					<description>Slayers Royal (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fslayersr%2Fslayers%20royale%20%28t-27903g%29.chd" size="280184992"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Kadokawa Shoten</studio>					<plot>Lina, Gourry, and Naga are barely together for a day before finding themselves yet again as the only thing standing in the way of world-wide cataclysm.

In towns you can move between multiple areas as well as look at objects and people to examine or talk to them. Lina will often get into (occasionally voiced) conversations with her companions, and in most conversations choices can come up that determine if the party receives stat upgrades or money.

A super-national group of combat experts from all over the world called Project Blue has been established to counteract Fata Morgana's evil doings. Sonic Wings Special is an enhanced and expanded port of Aero Fighters Special (Sonic Wings Limited in Japan), a coin-op shoot-'em-up with vertical scrolling. The original coin-op game uses altered levels, graphics and many features from Aero Fighters, Aero Fighters 2 and Aero Fighters 3. The home console version adds new characters and endings, new bosses, updated graphics and unlockable planes. There are also Time Attack and 2-player modes. The game uses a branching stage system, so it is impossible to see all levels in one sitting. There is a total of 14 playable characters and many different endings (some of which are reused from previous games in the series). Overall the game has a comic feel. As of Summer 2012, the Android version of Sonic Wings Special has only 4 playable characters with 4 endings and 9 stages. However, the publisher is planning to add further elements of the original version.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>			</game>			<game name="Sorvice (Jpn)">					<description>Sorvice (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsorvice%2Fsorvice%20%28j%29%20%28t-16609g%29.chd" size="199667192"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Altron</studio>					<plot>Scorcher is a futuristic racing game by Scavenger.

To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration.

The unique selling point of Sega Rally was the ability to drive on different surfaces (including asphalt, gravel and mud), with different friction properties, with the car's handling changing accordingly. As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre.

(Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) boasting the largest military force in history, suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed. Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania.

After open-wheel, stock and rally cars, Sega took on the popular European Touring Car races (factory models modified for racing), featuring four real models (Alfa Romeo 155V6TI, Toyota Supra GT, AMG Mercedes C-Class and Opel Calibra V6) as well as some hidden cars. Some models feature four-wheel drive (easier to control on sharper turns) while other only have rear-wheel drive (forcing the player to calculate turns properly so the car doesn't skid). Because of this, gameplay is notoriously tighter and less forgiving than in any of the previous titles by Sega. Like with other Sega arcade ports, this home versions features both an &amp;quot;Arcade&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;PC&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;Saturn&amp;quot; mode (the biggest difference being the time constraints and inability to use tweaked cars in arcade) with the usual Championship (three races in a row) and Time Attack modes, and a 2P split-screen race is also available. There are three tracks, plus one more as the final race (as usual with contemporary Sega arcade racers), and two viewpoints (behind and front bumper) are at the disposal of the player.As usual, there are additional modes, tracks and cars to be unlocked for those proficient in the game.Another feature was the &amp;quot;Global Ranking&amp;quot; mode, where players of either version could e-mail Sega of Japan a password containing his times, and compare them to the World's finest players, as well as in special one-day only &amp;quot;Global Net Events&amp;quot;.</plot>					<genre>Racing / Driving</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11339-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114425-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220245-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11339-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/114426-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164493-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220246-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220247-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220243-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/220244-sega-touring-car-championship-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11339.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="SteamGear Mash (Jpn)">					<description>SteamGear Mash (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsteamgea%2Fsteamgear%20mash%20%28japan%29.chd" size="286190534"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Takara</studio>					<plot>SteamGear Mash is an isometric platformer.

Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a &quot;wire framed&quot; virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>09/11/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/12201-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/173822-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/12201-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/173823-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/173824-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/173825-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530073-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530074-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-before-diving-into-the.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530075-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-evading-a-swarm-of-enemies.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530076-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-enemy-infested-bridge.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/530077-steam-heart-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-trying-to-deal-with-the.jpg</snapshot5>			</game>			<game name="Shin Theme Park (Jpn)">					<description>Shin Theme Park (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fsthemepk%2Fshin%20theme%20park%20%28j%29%20%28t-10618g%29.chd" size="311341128"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Electronic Arts Victor</studio>					<plot>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog.

Another goal for the player to aim for is to have a high score by beating the levels (referred to as waves in the game) as fast as possible.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1994</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253490-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253491-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253492-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253493-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606574-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606575-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606576-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Sega Ages - Shukudai ga Tant-R (Jpn)">					<description>Sega Ages - Shukudai ga Tant-R (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Ftantr%2Fsyukudai%20ga%20tant-r%20%28gs-9042%29.chd" size="5912374"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Sega Ages: Volume 1 contains three games previously released in Japan as stand-alone titles; Sega Ages Vol.2 Space Harrier, Sega Ages OutRun and Sega Ages After Burner II.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11328-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253490-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253491-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253492-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253493-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606574-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606575-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606576-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11328.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Sega Ages - Shukudai ga Tant-R (Jpn)">					<description>Sega Ages - Shukudai ga Tant-R (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Ftantr%2Fsyukudai%20ga%20tant-r%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0143%29.chd" size="5905601"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Sega Ages: Volume 1 contains three games previously released in Japan as stand-alone titles; Sega Ages Vol.2 Space Harrier, Sega Ages OutRun and Sega Ages After Burner II.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11328-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253490-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253491-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253492-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/253493-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606574-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606575-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606576-tama-adventurous-ball-in-giddy-labyrinth-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11328.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Detana Twinbee Yahoo!

In addition to a new storyline, players will find new moves and new characters. In this installment, a mystery man has stolen the Toshinhei Replicant and is wreaking havoc on the world. What better way to get to the bottom of this mess than by getting in a ring and fighting it out?Alongside the eleven fighters from Toshinden 2 is a batch of new fighters. They include RonRon, a wimpy scientist who has the unfortunate tendency of falling down while doing some of her moves; Ripper, a murderer who carries around spinning blades; Repli, the Toshinhei Replicant with the moves of both Eiji and Kayin; and Wolf, the final boss (who beats his opponent into submission with a stick). Though weak fighters, these new characters fit into the Toshinden mythos just fine.The graphics in Toshinden URA don't stand up to those found in the Playstation version. The backgrounds appear blocky, as do the fireballs and other special moves sprites. The character animation is somewhat choppy, and the graphics appear to be pixelated (the main 3-D enhancement is the ability to dodge incoming attacks by diving out of the way, but it doesn't make the game worthwhile). This version adds some full-motion video intros and a video that plays if you get a double perfect against any character. The music is the standard fare for fighting games, and the hits and noises aren't anything special.</plot>					<genre>ActionFighting</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-4.jpg</fanart4>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7971-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/178662-ghen-war-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7971-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/178664-ghen-war-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/178663-ghen-war-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7971.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Tenchi Muyou!

They don't realize that at this moment they unleashed a powerful demon into the world, and that this demon has already possessed the soul of one of the boys...The Apocalypse IV is the first Tengai Maky game that is set outside of the Japan-like country Jipang. Much like Jipang of earlier games, United States of the late 19th century is not in a historically correct environment in this game, but an alternate world populated by demons, Biblical figures, and deliberate clichs (cardboard Native Americans, pop culture references, etc). The gameplay largely follows the general Japanese RPG template and Tengai Maky gameplay style in particular. As in the previous games, magic spells have to be sought out and acquired rather than learned or bought. A notable change is the absence of random enemies - all the enemies are visibly wandering on the world map or in the dungeons.

Unlike the arcade port Tetris Plus which was released a few months earlier, it was specifically made for the console. This version includes a single player mode as well as multiplayer against an AI or between two human players. The single player mode works like traditional Tetris and uses the same rotation rules as Sega's earlier arcade game conversions. Like always the player guides blocks down a well with the aim of creating lines at the bottom. These lines are then removed and the player earns points. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the well, but in this version there is a continue option allowing the player to keep playing at the current level. The multiplayer works the same way but with one difference: if more than one line is removed the opponent's next few blocks will fall at a greater pace. The number of lines removed affects how many blocks will be sped up. A multiplayer game is played over a set number of matches and the aim is simply to stay alive longer than the opponent. </plot>					<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/31353-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804742-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804743-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804741-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-the-tetris-factory.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804744-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-starting-out.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804745-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-removing-a-line.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804746-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804747-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-removing-two-lines.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804748-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-level-4.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804750-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-level-6.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/804751-tetris-s-sega-saturn-screenshot-removing-four-lines.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Thunder Force V (Jpn)">					<description>Thunder Force V (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Ftf5%2Fthunder%20force%20v%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0136%29.chd" size="393175974"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Technosoft</studio>					<plot>In a grim future where a once-benevolent alien technology has turned against humanity, only a ragtag group of ace pilots can save the Earth from total annihilation.

More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>07/31/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7942-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213310-theme-park-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/17562-theme-park-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7942-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51311-theme-park-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/51310-theme-park-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/17563-theme-park-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/17566-theme-park-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7942.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Time Commando (Jpn)">					<description>Time Commando (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Ftimecomm%2Ftime%20commando%20%28j%29.chd" size="369972429"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Acclaim Japan</studio>					<plot>In the near future, the military has created an advance computerized combat simulation, which allowed participants to be trained in various forms of combat throughout human history.

Each of the three games features different protagonist who are all childhood friends of Shiori Fujisaki, the main heroine from the Tokimeki Memorial series. Player can enter the name of the protagonist at the beginning of the game, or accept the default one.In this, first story, the protagonist is a high-school sophomore who is member of a soccer club. As substitute player he doesn't get much chance to play, but is secretly practicing in order to gain skill level and show his teammates and the coach why he should play. Luckily for him, he's not alone, as the manager on the team, Saki Nijino, is supporting him in his training.

In addition to a new storyline, players will find new moves and new characters. In this installment, a mystery man has stolen the Toshinhei Replicant and is wreaking havoc on the world. What better way to get to the bottom of this mess than by getting in a ring and fighting it out?Alongside the eleven fighters from Toshinden 2 is a batch of new fighters. They include RonRon, a wimpy scientist who has the unfortunate tendency of falling down while doing some of her moves; Ripper, a murderer who carries around spinning blades; Repli, the Toshinhei Replicant with the moves of both Eiji and Kayin; and Wolf, the final boss (who beats his opponent into submission with a stick). Though weak fighters, these new characters fit into the Toshinden mythos just fine.The graphics in Toshinden URA don't stand up to those found in the Playstation version. The backgrounds appear blocky, as do the fireballs and other special moves sprites. The character animation is somewhat choppy, and the graphics appear to be pixelated (the main 3-D enhancement is the ability to dodge incoming attacks by diving out of the way, but it doesn't make the game worthwhile). This version adds some full-motion video intros and a video that plays if you get a double perfect against any character. The music is the standard fare for fighting games, and the hits and noises aren't anything special.</plot>					<genre>ActionFighting</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7971-4.jpg</fanart4>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7971-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/60247-battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66571-battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7971-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/60248-battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164491-battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66572-battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/251530-battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/251531-battle-arena-toshinden-ultimate-revenge-attack-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart9>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7971.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Touge King - The Spirits 2 (Jpn)">					<description>Touge King - The Spirits 2 (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Ftouge2%2Ftouge%20-%20king%20the%20spirits%202%20mihonhin%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0930%29.chd" size="365647707"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<plot>As a sequel to Tge King: The Spirits, this game continues in the same vein of fast racing over the dangerous ridges and mountain tops.

The game is presented in third person perspective. Lara is always visible and the camera follows the action from behind or over her shoulder. The world she inhabits is fully drawn in three dimensions and characterized by its cubic nature. Ledges, walls and ceilings mostly sit at 90 degrees to each other, but sometimes feature sloping planes.The object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving puzzles to gain access to an ultimate prize, usually a powerful artefact. Gunplay is restricted to the killing of various animals that appear throughout each stage, although occasionally Lara may be faced with a human opponent. Instead the emphasis lies on solving puzzles and performing trick jumps to complete each level.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<releasedate>10/31/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-5.jpg</fanart5>					<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-6.jpg</fanart6>					<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-7.jpg</fanart7>					<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2779-8.jpg</fanart8>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2779-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/16132-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35783-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/68056-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2779-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/16133-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/167457-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/35784-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/131510-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/68055-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212895-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212896-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-shot-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212897-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212898-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-tibet-intro-shot-1.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212899-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-tibet-intro-shot-2-check.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212900-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-loading-screen.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212901-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-lara-is-about-to-scale.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212902-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-that-s-one-big-ass-gate.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212903-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-game-performs-admirably.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212904-tomb-raider-sega-saturn-screenshot-ohh-i-am-so-getting-eaten.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2779.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Trash It!

The super dash meter takes away gas, but it is possible to charge it up as much as one wants until it maxes out. In addition to killing enemies and bosses, super dashing can also break down certain walls that lead to secret items. Bosses each have a weak point somewhere on their body that is seen just before the battle begins.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526087-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526088-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-create-your-sign.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526089-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526090-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-deppy-did-not-have-a.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526091-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-chapter-introductory.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526092-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-first-level.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526093-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-stunned.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526094-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-on-a-moving-elevator.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/526095-tryrush-deppy-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-first-boss.jpg</snapshot9>			</game>			<game name="Tunnel B1 (USA)">					<description>Tunnel B1 (USA)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Ftunnelb1%2Fsat-0670-tunnel_b1-usa.chd" size="221703372"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Ocean</studio>					<plot>You are on a mission to destroy the ultimate weapon of your enemy.

On the ship, Bilan escapes, and Garian must stop him before he reaches the captain's cabin......at which point the game's narrative is split into three different scenarios (called Parallels), which depend on how much time it has taken the player to reach the captain. Parallel I occurs if the player needed more than four minutes; in this scenario, Bilan escapes and goes on a killing spree, and Garian must catch him again. Should the player need between three and four minutes to reach the captain, Parallel II is triggered; Garian defeats Bilan, but the monster undergoes a surprising transformation, and Garian realizes that a deeper plot has to be uncovered. Finally, if the player manages to reach the captain under three minutes, Parallel III begins, with Bilan being confined, but escaping once again. Dark Savior is a 3D action game with elements of platforming, puzzle-solving, and battles that resembles fights of a fighting game.

You can also generate random maps by yourself and let the hero perform the same quest in your own world.</plot>					<genre>Action, Role-Playing (RPG)</genre>					<releasedate>04/27/1995</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11369-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/198689-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11369-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/198690-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/219812-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208332-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-the-land-of-hydlide.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208333-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-demon-varalys-comes.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208334-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-princess-vainly.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208335-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-that-s-what-you.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208336-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-intro-umm-pixies.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208337-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208338-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-main-menu.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208339-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-that-large-pink-crystal.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208340-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-beating-up-some-slimes.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/208341-virtual-hydlide-sega-saturn-screenshot-in-game-menu.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11369.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Wachen Rder (Jpn)">					<description>Wachen Rder (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fwachenro%2Fwachenroeder%20%28japan%29.chd" size="393492679"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Sega</studio>					<plot>Edoald Island is an isolated strip of earth surrounded by fog.

Competition (in Arcade, Saturn or Practice modes) includes 11 events featuring eight athletes of different nationalities - Li Huang, Karl Vain, Joe Kudou, Ellen Reggiani, Aleksei Rigel and Rick Blade are joined by B.B. (replacing Jef Jansens, who appears as a secret athlete) and Johann Stensen (instead of Femi Kadiena). The game is a typical Winter-sports game, in the line of those released by Epyx but with a more arcade feel. The events include:Speed Skiing: A simple dashing event where the goal is to descend the hill as fast as possible (in speeds over 200 km/h). Action is reduced to mash the button to gain speed.Ski Jumping: Composed by four parts: The run up (mash the button to gain speed), the jump (selecting the angle), the flight (mash the button to gain extra length) and the landing (pressing the action button too early will lose valuable meters, too late will cost the jump).Downhill: A simplified version of the real downhill event. It's impossible to miss the gates, and the challenge is to get a strong start-up, keep a straight path not losing speed hitting the fences and hitting the action button to jump hills perfectly.Short Track Speed Skating: A straightforward event where the directional pad controls the direction of the athlete along the speed button to control the pace. As the event runs for over 40 seconds, it's possible to hold second position, making the opponent cut air resistance which allows the player to reach fastest speeds with less button presses.Skeleton: The first event in the ice tunnels, it requires a fast run-up followed by a strong entrance in the tunnels. By pressing the action button it's possible to slow down the sled and make more controlled turns, or the athlete can fall from it, which not only loses time but also requires a small run-up.Slalom: Just like the Downhill, it's impossible to miss a gate in the Slalom. After an initial sprint the player has to press the action button to approach each flag in the best way possible. Hitting the button too early or too late will make the athlete hit the flag, losing valuable time.Aerial: An event similar to the Ski Jump. Instead of offering a &amp;quot;click-along&amp;quot; version, the player starts by setting the difficulty of the jump, and then three parts follow: in the run-up, the player sets the speed by mashing the speed button, followed by the jump which sets the strength (by pressing the action button) and when the athlete leaves the launch ramp, the player must mash the speed button once again to complete the jump. To complete a jump, the player must fill each section of the jump bar by making enough button pressesBobsleigh: In all similar to the Skeleton, except there's no option to slow down.Speed Skating: Another simple button-mashing event but with a twist: speed must be controlled on the turns, or the athlete will slip out losing a few seconds in the process. The speed can be controlled by a color graph above the power bar.Snowboard: A mix between the Slalom and Downhill. There are several gates to be passed, plus two jumps. Unlike the other two events, it's possible to miss a gate, which carries a one second penalty for each missed.Cross Country: The stamina-influenced event. There's a long track with some hills that can be taken for advantage, as during downhill slopes it's possible to gain a lot of speed without losing stamina.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-4s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11376-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/63223-winter-heat-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/63224-winter-heat-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/63225-winter-heat-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11376.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="WipEout 2097 (Euro)">					<description>WipEout 2097 (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fwipe2097%2Fwipeout%20xl%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0496%29.chd" size="413126003"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1998</releasedate>					<studio>Psygnosis</studio>					<plot>WipEout XL is set in the year 2097, around four decades after its predecessor. Instead of the F3600 anti-gravity racing competition, the game features an even faster and more dangerous tournament: the F5000 AG league. The gameplay system is similar to that of the previous game: players race against each other or computer in high-speed futuristic environments, liberally picking up weapons scattered around the stages and using them against the opponents to finish the race in the highest position.Each vehicle is provided with a shield; once this shield is breached (by weapons or other kinds of damage), the craft explodes. As in the first game, the vehicles move at very high speeds. The game's four difficulty levels are used to crank the speed up and down, with the highest setting corresponding to the highest speed. In addition to the main championship mode, there are also challenge modes, winning in which rewards the player with faster game settings, new tracks, and new vehicles.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>09/18/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11377-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/37369-wipeout-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26953-wipeout-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164448-wipeout-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11377-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/37370-wipeout-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/37371-wipeout-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164449-wipeout-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164450-wipeout-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart9>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204437-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-an-intro-shot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204438-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204439-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-team-selection-screen.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204440-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-a-track-specific-loading-screen.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204441-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-the-first-track-is-incredibly.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204442-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-this-banner-bears-a-very-grammatically.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204443-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-some-nifty-commie-murals-on.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204444-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-entering-a-tunnel.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204445-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-along-with-some-real-advertisements.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/204446-wipeout-sega-saturn-screenshot-someone-is-about-to-get-a-face.jpg</snapshot10>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11377.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="WipEout (Euro)">					<description>WipEout (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fwipeout%2F0332-wipeout-eur.chd" size="438577145"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Psygnosis</studio>					<plot>WipEout is a futuristic racing game set in the year 2052.

This will entail a meeting of the two jewels again, for the second jewel seems to be owned by his father.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>			</game>			<game name="Wizardry VI &amp; VII Complete (Jpn)">					<description>Wizardry VI &amp; VII Complete (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fwizcomp%2Fwizardry%20vi%20%26%20vii%20complete%20%28jpn%29%20%28dw0619%29.chd" size="137421059"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Data East</studio>					<plot>This compilation contains reworked versions of two games:Wizardry: Bane of the Cosmic ForgeWizardry: Crusaders of the Dark SavantThe player can opt to start any of the two games from the main menu, using a common custom-made party or creating every character from scratch.

It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-16s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7943-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/144138-worms-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/63502-worms-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7943-1.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/144139-worms-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/63503-worms-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/186032-worms-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart7>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7943.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Winning Post 2 - Program '96 (Jpn)">					<description>Winning Post 2 - Program '96 (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fwpost296%2Fwinning%20post%202%20program%2096%20%28j%29%20%28t-7620g%29.chd" size="82972237"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Koei</studio>					<plot>Winning Post lets the player take control of a stable of horse, breeding and training them for the ultimate goal, to win the French Grand Prix.The player can hire breeders, trainers and jockeys and race in over 240 different races to earn more money to buy even better personnel and breed faster and stronger horses as well as keeping their horses healthy.

Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they feel as if something is missing. Finding that the Christmas Star that usually sits at the top of the Twin Seeds Christmas tree is missing, the pair head off to Nightopia to find it. There, they meet up with Nights again and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been Christmas-ified due to the kids' dreams of the holiday season. The trio of heroes must now take down a revived Gillwing and retrieve the Christmas Star from his lair. The game uses the Saturn's internal clock to change elements of the game according to the date and time. In November and January, the title screen label &quot;Nights: Limited Edition&quot; is changed to &quot;Winter Nights&quot;, with the lush greenery of the environment being replaced by white snow. During December, &quot;Christmas Nights&quot; mode is activated, resulting in further Christmas-themed alterations, such as item boxes becoming Christmas presents, Nightopians dressing in elf costumes, and Christmas trees replacing Ideya captures. The background music is replaced by an instrumental version of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, as well as there being a &quot;Christmas-like&quot; rendition of the boss theme. During the &quot;Winter Nights&quot; period, the weather in Spring Valley will change according to what hour it is. Other cosmetic changes are visible on New Year's Day, and loading the game on April Fool's Day results in Reala replacing Nights as the playable character.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>12/01/1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/9980-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/9980-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/33104-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/94338-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189799-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/33105-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/242692-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/94337-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74769-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/251369-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-inside-cover.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189800-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/145693-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-screenshot-christmas.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/145694-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-screenshot-christmas.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/145695-christmas-nights-into-dreams-sega-saturn-screenshot-christmas.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="X-Men - Children of the Atom (Euro)">					<description>X-Men - Children of the Atom (Euro)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fxmcota%2Fxmen-cota_-_sega-saturn_t-8108h.chd" size="394498800"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1995</releasedate>					<studio>Acclaim Entertainment</studio>					<plot>X-Men: Children of the Atom is a 2D fighting game and the first Capcom title to use licensed characters from the Marvel comic universe.

It is Capcom's third fighting game to feature Marvel Comics characters and the first game to match them against their own, with characters from Marvel's X-Men franchise being matched against the cast from the Street Fighter series.It was the first game to blend a tag team style of combat with the Street Fighter gameplay, as well as incorporating elements from Capcom's previous Marvel-themed fighting games, X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes. It was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998. However, the tag team feature was omitted from the PlayStation version due to memory limitations, while the Saturn version was only released in Japan.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<releasedate>11/21/1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<videoid>jXOuLEFsmoU</videoid>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/30470-1.png</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15984-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15985-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15988-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15986-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15987-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/30470-1.jpg</snapshot1>			</game>			<game name="The Yakyuuken Special - Konya wa 12 Kaisen!!

The Street Fighter cast is based on that of Street Fighter Alpha 2; however, the appearance and combat styles of some of them have been altered, to match the abilities of the X-Men heroes.The gameplay system is similar to that of the aforementioned games, adding a tag-team gameplay feature. The player controls one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag the waiting one in at any time by hitting specific buttons; the tag partner will jump in with an attack and taunt the enemy. Resting character gradually recuperate their health. The two partners can execute the so-called &amp;quot;variable attacks&amp;quot;, which depend on the combination of buttons pressed.The tag team feature has been omitted from the PlayStation version due to memory limitations.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>1997</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15984-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15985-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15988-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15986-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/15987-x-men-vs-street-fighter-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart5>			</game>			<game name="Yellow Brick Road (Jpn)">					<description>Yellow Brick Road (Jpn)</description>					<system>MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3</system>					<rom name="MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3.zip/MESS_0.149_CHD_saturn_3%2Fyellowbr%2Fyellow%20brick%20road%20%28t-8109g%29.chd" size="296555337"/>					<releasedate>01/01/1996</releasedate>					<studio>Acclaim Japan</studio>					<plot>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties.

Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. The game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.Battles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses.

During a summer vacation Takuya discovers a strange orb in his father's room, along with a letter containing information about the existence of a parallel world. At first Takuya doesn't take it seriously, but soon he realizes that he possesses a device that allows him to travel to an alternate universe. Is his father alive, after all? If so, where is he? Meetings and conversations with many beautiful women, as well as a suspenseful investigation await Takuya!Yu-No: Kono Yo no Hate de Koi o Utau Shjo (the sub-title meaning A Girl Who Chants Love At the Bound of This World) is a Japanese-style adventure (still screens viewed from first-person perspective, a lot of dialogue) with a unique feature: multiple story paths are shown on a special map and can be accessed within the same playing session, by using orbs like the one Takuya finds in his home at the beginning of the game.

Where the biggest change lies, of course, is in the transition from the text parser to an interface controllable by a console's joystick.  Adapting some sentence-construction conventions from the graphical adventure game genre (and the interfaces of Lucasfilm's and Legend's early entries in particular), menus selectable with a joystick pointer fill in for common &amp;quot;action&amp;quot; verbs while icons represent the inventory items the verbs influence; an expanded compass rose permits precise navigation of the Flatheadian ruins. (Alas!  No secret joystick-button combination for &amp;quot;xyzzy&amp;quot;!)In short: as faithful a reproduction of the original experience as you're going to find without employing a keyboard or voice-recognition software, plus &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; graphics, sound and music!</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>1996</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189780-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-front-cover.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189627-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189628-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/189629-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-other.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/786090-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/786091-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/786092-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/786093-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/786094-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/786095-zork-i-the-great-underground-empire-sega-saturn-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>	</datafile>
