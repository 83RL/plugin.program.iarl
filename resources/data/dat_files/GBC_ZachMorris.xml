It was released on October 21, 1998. It is the successor of the Game Boy.The Game Boy Color, as suggested by the name, features a color screen. It is slightly thicker and taller than the Game Boy Light. As with the original Game Boy, it has an 8-bit processor and the custom Zilog Z80 CPU.Developer:  NintendoManufacturer:  NintendoCPU:  Zilog Z80Memory:  32 KBSound:  2 square wave channels, 1 wave channel, 1 noise channelDisplay:  160 x 144Media:  CartridgeMax Controllers:  1</emu_comment>			<emu_thumb>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/platform/boxart/41-1.jpg</emu_thumb>			<emu_banner>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/platform/banners/41-1.jpg</emu_banner>			<emu_fanart>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg/753px-Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg</emu_fanart>			<emu_logo>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Game_Boy_Color_logo.svg/320px-Game_Boy_Color_logo.svg.png</emu_logo>			<emu_trailer>OIkM6Lfq-1w</emu_trailer>		</header>			<game name="007 - The World Is Not Enough (USA, Europe)">					<description>007 - The World Is Not Enough (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="E038E666" name="007 - The World Is Not Enough (USA, Europe).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>It seems that an MI-6 agent has been killed just before delivering a report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department.  As James Bond (yes, the James Bond), you're going to need your license to kill in order to find out who killed him, and return some stolen money to the King.  Based on the 1999 Bond film of the same title, 007: The World Is Not Enough spans 14 levels, each with several objectives.  Using all of the weapons and gadgetry you can get your hands on, you'll be challenged to upend a terrorist attack, free hostages from a train station, and much more.  To help you in your endeavors, you'll have access to a bomb disposal kit, digital camera, covert modem, grapple hook watch, night vision glasses, and about a dozen other items of the like.  The game lets you pick your character, your environment, a range of weapons that will be in play, and a scenario.  This adventure offers three different difficulty levels.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<releasedate>09/01/2001</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/20734-1.png</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/194760-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/192039-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/194761-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/450891-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-screenshot-part.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/450892-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-screenshot-main.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/450887-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-screenshot-main.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/450888-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-screenshot-dialogue.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/450889-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-screenshot-mission.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/450894-007-the-world-is-not-enough-game-boy-color-screenshot-level.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="10-Pin Bowling (USA) (Rumble Version)">					<description>10-Pin Bowling (USA) (Rumble Version)</description>					<rom crc="720C7023" name="10-Pin Bowling (USA) (Rumble Version).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>10-PIN BOWLING brings you all the fun of bowling in miniature form on your Game Boy Color.

Additionally, players can find these weapons and suits by taking different paths throughout the levels.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>02/06/2001</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/17449-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367360-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367361-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-main.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367362-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-stage.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367363-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-selecting.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367364-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-zooming.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367365-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-who.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367366-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-death.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367367-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-continue.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367368-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-why.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367369-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-they.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, The (USA)">					<description>Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, The (USA)</description>					<rom crc="2C4C2A5F" name="Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland, The (USA).zip" size="262144"/>					<plot>Sesame Street: The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland is an Action game, developed by Bonsai Entertainment Corp. and published by NewKidCo, which was released in 1999.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>10/01/1999</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21979-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367360-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367361-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-main.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367362-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-stage.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367363-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-selecting.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367364-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-zooming.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367365-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-who.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367366-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-death.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367367-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-continue.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367368-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-why.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/367369-action-man-search-for-base-x-game-boy-color-screenshot-they.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="AirForce Delta (USA)">					<description>AirForce Delta (USA)</description>					<rom crc="FF31CC92" name="AirForce Delta (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Ever been screaming along at Mach 2 and ordered to drop 6,000 pounds of bombs on a target no bigger than a Yugo?

In each level there is a checkered flag, to which Babe must take a herd. The sheep aren't very good at finding their own paths, so Babe has to walk them through every step of the way. Clear obstacles, set up roadblocks to make detours, and generally do what you have to in order to make a safe route for the sheep. Watch out for obstructions such as carts in the airport and rushing rivers on the farm. Detailed still-screens of all of Babe's friends appear between the levels to move the story along.

Not so fast though, because you need bullets for hunting, bait for fishing, and a license to do either of the two activities. Luckily, you can earn these items by playing a variety of mini-games. The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You'll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing. Once you've finally cleared them and gotten the items you need, you'll head out to catch your real prize.

Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Fliks harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>12/01/1998</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8600-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8600-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99822-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99823-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99821-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-a-cutscene.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99818-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99819-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/99820-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-level-3.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/619320-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-enough.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/619321-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-password.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/619322-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-story-cut.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/619323-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-game-boy-color-screenshot-high-jump.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/8600-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Bugs Bunny - Crazy Castle 3 (USA, Europe)">					<description>Bugs Bunny - Crazy Castle 3 (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="7A2801FB" name="Bugs Bunny - Crazy Castle 3 (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Bugs Bunny returns to crazy puzzle or action gaming on Game boy Color.

Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you'll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you'll have to find the one that works best for you.

The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind.

When the evil Yzma turns Kuzco into a llama, our hero must make his way through eight action-packed levels in order to return to his archenemy for the ultimate showdown. That will require jumping gaps, negotiating moving platforms, breaking down barriers, unlocking closed doors, and more. Of course, all of Yzma's dastardly minions will be after you, but you'll have a variety of attacks to thwart their efforts including spitting! Along your path, you'll collect red and gold coins, water jugs, and plenty of Aztec coins. There'll be lots of obstacles along the way (watch out for scorpions!), but with your wits, skills, and reflexes, you might just have a chance at defeating your enemies and returning to the life that's rightfully yours.

In this one-player flight sim, you take the role of a daring pilot who's flying an elite fighter jet. Slide into an inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but don't think that it's all fun and games. When the mission's complete, you'll have to carefully land your jet on an aircraft carrier.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>05/01/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21985-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282527-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/293504-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282528-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282529-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/293505-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715232-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715233-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-mode.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715234-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-championship.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715235-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-country.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715236-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-next.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715237-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-qualifying.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715238-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-vault.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715239-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-100m.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715240-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-110m.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/715242-espn-international-track-field-game-boy-color-screenshot-pole.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="F1 World Grand Prix II for Game Boy Color (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es)">					<description>F1 World Grand Prix II for Game Boy Color (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es)</description>					<rom crc="482E10C5" name="F1 World Grand Prix II for Game Boy Color (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>F1 World Grand Prix II for Game Boy Color is a Racing game, developed by ITL and published by Video System, which was released in 2000.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>01/01/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21934-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348075-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348076-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-mode-selection.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348077-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-starting.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348078-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-passing-cars.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348079-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-road-is-going.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348080-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-sharp-turn.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348081-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-curve-close.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348082-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-yahoo.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/744692-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-intro.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/744693-f1-world-grand-prix-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-team-select.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="FIFA 2000 (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">					<description>FIFA 2000 (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>					<rom crc="E6BC2E8C" name="FIFA 2000 (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Brace yourself for a soccer game that brings all of the wild fun of soccer home on your Game Boy Color! FIFA 2000 is a fully-licensed soccer game that has more than 60 teams from around the world with updated rosters appropriate to the 2000 season. You can choose to play one of five different gameplay modes. Exhibition mode is a quick game where you set the teams and the rules then hit the field. In Tournament mode, you'll square off against an assortment of other teams to see who can take home the final victory. Playoff mode has you playing the final teeth-to-the-grindstone matches where every victory counts. In League mode, you'll play through a full season that culminates in the playoffs to see who is the greatest. Finally, Indoor mode takes the game inside and changes up the rules a little bit, resulting in a fast-paced version of the original. Options available for every mode include weather settings, foul settings, wind, and more. You can also use the password to save all of your stats in League and Tournament modes.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>11/30/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21986-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/7447-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98043-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-fifa-2000-logo.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98044-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98045-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98046-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-team-selection.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98047-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-comparing-the-teams.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98048-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-shot-at-goal.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98049-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-goal-celebration.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98050-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-throw-in.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98042-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-goalkeeper.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98051-fifa-2000-game-boy-color-screenshot-match-summary.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Flintstones, The - Burgertime in Bedrock (USA)">					<description>Flintstones, The - Burgertime in Bedrock (USA)</description>					<rom crc="14D8CC5D" name="Flintstones, The - Burgertime in Bedrock (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>05/30/2001</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21987-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/166117-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/166118-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/166119-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250593-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250594-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250595-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250596-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250597-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250598-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250599-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250600-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250601-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/250602-the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock-game-boy-color-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Force 21 (USA) (En,Fr,De)">					<description>Force 21 (USA) (En,Fr,De)</description>					<rom crc="2DCD0A0A" name="Force 21 (USA) (En,Fr,De).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>PC fans craving real-time strategy action on Game Boy Color may have found their title with FORCE 21. In the year 2015, World War III has broken out. Technology has progressed to the point that air-based nuclear attacks are ineffective, so warfare will be conducted the old-fashioned way: through large-scaled attacks of armored units and infantry. In this one-player strategy or action game, you'll choose to either control the American or the Chinese military forces, each side comprised of the same eight different unit types. From the speed and power of a tactical helicopter attack to the all-out brawn of a platoon of tanks, you'll have all the warfare options you'll need to carry out your plan of attack. In order to complete the game, you'll have to battle your way through 16 different missions that take place all over the world, in such locations as barren snowfields, yawning deserts, and crowded cityscapes.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<releasedate>12/01/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21988-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14271-force-21-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14272-force-21-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462757-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-splash-shown-in-intro-sequence.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462761-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-language-selection-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462762-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462764-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-choose-your-side.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462766-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-commanding-your-tanks.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561403-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561404-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-mission-completed.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561405-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-mission-failed.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561406-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-always-shoot-first.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561407-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-tactical-map.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Formula One 2000 (USA)">					<description>Formula One 2000 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="703C057F" name="Formula One 2000 (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Formula One 2000 is a Racing game, developed by Tarantula Studios and published by Take-Two Interactive, which was released in 2000.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<releasedate>12/18/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21989-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14271-force-21-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14272-force-21-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462757-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-splash-shown-in-intro-sequence.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462761-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-language-selection-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462762-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462764-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-choose-your-side.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/462766-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-commanding-your-tanks.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561403-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561404-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-mission-completed.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561405-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-mission-failed.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561406-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-always-shoot-first.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/561407-force-21-game-boy-color-screenshot-tactical-map.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Frogger (USA) (Rev B)">					<description>Frogger (USA) (Rev B)</description>					<rom crc="D9A22E5D" name="Frogger (USA) (Rev B).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>It's tough to be a frog!

The game, which stars Sir Arthur, a knight on a mission to rescue Princess Guinevere, travels players through six huge 2D scrolling levels rained with obstacles, enemies and other infuriating hazards. It was all too easy to meet one's doom at the near end of a stage as the difficulty level is unforgiving and have to start all over, but because of the clever coin-munching design and atmospheric presentation, the drag to keep playing never loosened. It's still regarded as one of the greats.

Much like the classic story, THE GRINCH takes place in the idyllic Whoville--where your aim is to cease the event called Christmas. You attempt to do so by wreaking havoc and solving challenging puzzles. The folks of Whoville will try to stop your efforts with love and happiness (blech!), so be on your toes if you hope to avoid them and effectively ruin the holiday. To make things a little easier, you can throw snowballs at the peacenik villagers to keep them at a distance. Each level will present new obstacles and challenges, and the Dr. Seuss world is faithfully translated to the video game format.

LITTLE MERMAID 2 PINBALL FRENY for the Game Boy Color is just what the name implies, a frenzied pinball game. There are two different boards that can be played on, each with several variations of their own. The Ariel board contains paddles that are put at varying places to throw off people too used to traditional pinball machines, and it makes them learn some new strategies. The Melody board has many different ramps and drop spots to create its own unique atmosphere. Each board contains eight mini-games that differ from simple actions to more complex objectives. The game also comes with a built-in Rumble Pak, guaranteed to deliver plenty of shaking to help make the game a more realistic experience.

Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through.

To get rid of the bubbles, you can grab bubbles of one color from the pile and move them to another area. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they will explode and destroy all of the like-colored bubbles around them. When bubbles are destroyed, those remaining in the pile float up and cause more to bubbles to burst in a chain reaction. This is a rather simple premise, but it's not easy to master. While the single-player game is fun, use a link cable and share the fun with a friend. Try to clear as many bubbles as possible with MAGICAL DROP.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>10/18/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22021-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147197-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147198-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369476-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen-and.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369478-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-opening-animation.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369480-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369482-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-select-your-character.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369484-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369486-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-i-have-pulled-down.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369487-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-i-placed-it-so.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369488-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-level-18-did-not.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369489-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/369490-magical-drop-iii-game-boy-color-screenshot-enter-your-initials.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Magical Tetris Challenge (USA)">					<description>Magical Tetris Challenge (USA)</description>					<rom crc="F53CF66C" name="Magical Tetris Challenge (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy host eight different versions of Tetris in three modes of play: Quest Mode, One-Player Mode, and Two-Player Mode. Quest Mode involves exploring an overhead view of town and then challenging rival characters to a game of Tetris. Defeating an opponent earns players one of the six coins needed to win. One-Player Mode is a single game of the available Tetris variants, while the Two-Player Mode features three games: UpDown Tetris, Magical Tetris, and the exclusive Harmony Tetris. Harmony Tetris is a cooperative game where each player tries to clear out half the block bin by eliminating lines. If a piece doesn't fit, players can switch screens and use it to help their teammate.UpDown Tetris is a race to see who can clear the most lines in the shortest time. Each cleared line is sent to the opponent's screen and vice versa, until one player can no longer move. Magical Tetris is a head-to-head game in which players send obstacle blocks to their opponent after clearing lines and forming combos. Both UpDown Tetris and Magical Tetris can be played against the computer.In addition to standard Tetris, players can try Signal Tetris, Tower Tetris, and Target Tetris. Signal Tetris involves changing a horizontal line of blocks to match the ten colors forming the bottom line. Tower Tetris challenges players to repair holes from a partially filled screen of blocks, while Target Tetris is a puzzle game where the object is to clear the screen using a limited number of pieces.Three difficulty settings are available for both novices and pros alike: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Progress during the Quest Mode and all scores are saved to one of three files via battery backup. As with most two-player games on the handheld, a link cable is required to connect both systems for simultaneous play. Options for two-player games include adjustable rounds and handicap.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<releasedate>03/08/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8627-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14279-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14280-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/213060-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104448-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104436-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-select.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104438-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-entering.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104437-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-selecting.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104439-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-disney.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104440-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-adventure.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104441-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-in-your.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104442-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-stage-clear.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104443-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-mickey.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/104444-magical-tetris-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-maybe-a.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Marble Madness (USA, Europe)">					<description>Marble Madness (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="4EC78785" name="Marble Madness (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>The objective is simple - roll your marbles to the goal line.

There are four different horses to choose from, each with a distinct look and style. Each horse has varying statistics for speed, jumping, and handling, requiring the player to make a careful choice to find the horse best-fitted to their racing style. Before riding you can also alter the clothing of the athlete to something of your choosing, then watch the changed sprite during gameplay. There are two modes of play: the first is a Training mode that lets you practice the controls and the course for the real competitions, and the second is the Steeplechase mode, where the real challenges lie. In this mode you must race through a course without being stopped by any of the many obstacles strewn about.

Lending his expertise to the creation of this game, Hoffman makes sure that every turn, ramp, and flip is up to snuff.

The Matchbox Emergency Patrol, that's who! Play as a firefighter, police officer, or paramedic in this high-energy challenge based on real-life crises. Whichever hero you choose, you'll receive word of a situation over your radio, hop in your designated vehicle, and navigate your way to the scene of the potential disaster. Of course, there's really no way to know exactly what the scene is going to be when you arrive, so you'd better be on your toes. You might find a robbery in progress, but it might just be two people having an argument, so use your best judgment as to how to handle the situation. Modeled after the Matchbox Emergency Patrol series of die-cast toy vehicles, MATCHBOX EMERGENCY PATROL (the game) is an in-depth adventure revolving around crimes, accidents, and medical emergencies.

Like the Game Boy incarnations of the classic Mega Man series, Mega Man Xtreme 2, reuses elements from first three home console Mega Man X games. The player is tasked with completing a series of side-scrolling levels by avoiding obstacles and destroying end-stage bosses. Stages are typically linear and present a number of traps and enemy robots to combat; collecting DNA Souls and items that refill health, ammunition, and extra lives; power-ups that improve the player's maximum health; and armor parts that grant X new abilities. Defeating the Maverick boss at the stage's end will earn the player its special weapon. These weapons can then be used to more easily other bosses, as each one is weak to a unique weapon. After each level, the DNA Souls gathered in the level will accumulate, which the player can use to purchase additional upgrades from Iris. These upgrades range from speed and power improvements, health rechargers, and shielding.</plot>					<genre>ActionPlatform</genre>					<releasedate>10/30/2001</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/8631-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/8631-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/8631-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8631-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14409-mega-man-xtreme-2-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8631-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/14410-mega-man-xtreme-2-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/179813-mega-man-xtreme-2-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart5>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116203-mega-man-xtreme-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116204-mega-man-xtreme-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-a-redesigned-menu.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116202-mega-man-xtreme-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-cut-scene-iris.jpg</snapshot3>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/8631-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Men in Black - The Series (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">					<description>Men in Black - The Series (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>					<rom crc="65B8B343" name="Men in Black - The Series (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, MEN IN BLACK: The Series 2 starts with aliens invading the Earth.

As in all of the METAL GEAR games, stealth and smarts will work much better than brute strength.</plot>					<genre>ActionStealth</genre>					<releasedate>05/05/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/8633-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8633-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64701-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64704-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/251262-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8633-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64702-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64703-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/64705-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/287319-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart9>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168217-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro-animation.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168218-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168219-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-lying-prone.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168220-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-vr-mission-stage.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168221-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-incoming-transmissions.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/168222-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-deployment-by-parachute.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623839-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-dialogue-with-mei.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623840-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-soldier-doesn-t.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623841-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-find-rations.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/623842-metal-gear-solid-game-boy-color-screenshot-stealth-elements.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/8633-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Metal Walker (USA)">					<description>Metal Walker (USA)</description>					<rom crc="3BE68391" name="Metal Walker (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena. As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.</plot>					<genre>Role-PlayingStrategy</genre>					<releasedate>02/06/2001</releasedate>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8802-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8802-1.png</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350300-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-your-first-stage-metal.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350301-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-a-flood-attack.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350302-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-scanning-for-flood.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350303-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-neo-city-looks-like.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350304-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-cyclops-man-is-pleased.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350305-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-analyzing-something.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350306-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-walls-in-neo-city.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350307-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-a-claw-game.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350308-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-dad-restored.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/350309-metal-walker-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-final-dungeon.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout (USA)">					<description>Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout (USA)</description>					<rom crc="D77971C0" name="Mia Hamm Soccer Shootout (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>The thrills and excitement of international women's soccer comes to the Game Boy Color with MIA HAMM SOCCER SHOOTOUT.

This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game's arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>05/01/2001</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/21853-1.png</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/17872-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/17871-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228957-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228958-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228959-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228960-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228961-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228962-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228963-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228964-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228965-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/228966-microsoft-puzzle-collection-entertainment-pack-game-boy-color.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Millennium Winter Sports (USA)">					<description>Millennium Winter Sports (USA)</description>					<rom crc="B57DABAE" name="Millennium Winter Sports (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>MILLENNIUM WINTER SPORTS allows you to experience the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat in eight winter sports.

In the anime, the monsters were created by scientists.It is said that the &quot;disc stones&quot; are almost impossible to find among the ancient ruins. It is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began. As time passed these monster battles became extremely popular, and monster breeding became the standard pastime of the land. Eventually disc stones were found around the entire world.

Rather than offering a standard football game, NFL BLITZ 2000 changes the rules a little. The game is played seven-on-seven, and it takes 30-yards to get a first down. But probably the most important rule change is that there are no penalties. When you start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl. No matter how you play the game, you will not miss a second of the action, thanks to three different camera angles.

This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>08/01/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8637-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57609-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8637-1.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57610-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/57611-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/190751-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart6>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122047-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122045-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-pac.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122052-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-in.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122051-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-when.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122050-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-eating.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122046-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-pac.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122053-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-pac.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/122049-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-pac.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/140261-pac-man-special-color-edition-game-boy-color-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot9>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/8637-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/8637.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Paperboy (USA, Europe)">					<description>Paperboy (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="C0A98305" name="Paperboy (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>In PAPERBOY, all you have to do is deliver the newspaper to your subscribers.

The game itself doesn't utilize a first-person perspective for the action -- instead, Perfect Dark GBC features a pseudo-overhead viewpoint, much like what Konami did with Metal Gear: Ghost Babel and what Rebellion did with Mission: Impossible.

Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he's considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It's not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that's really its charm.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>12/06/2001</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22048-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/278061-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/292512-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/292513-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626226-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626227-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-first.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626228-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-game-starts.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626229-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-ok-liana.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626230-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-left-and.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626231-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-scorpion.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626232-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-strange.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626233-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-diamonds.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626234-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-wild-man.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/626235-pitfall-beyond-the-jungle-game-boy-color-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Pocket Bomberman (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">					<description>Pocket Bomberman (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>					<rom crc="FA2A66E9" name="Pocket Bomberman (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Pocket Bomberman is a platforming action game first released for the Game Boy in 1997, and later as a launch title for the Game Boy Color in 1998.[1]Pocket Bomberman features gameplay that revolves around using bombs to box in enemies and blowing them to bits.

Pokmon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokmon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch 'em all.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>07/21/2001</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2362-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2362-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2362-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2362-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2362-5.jpg</fanart5>					<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2362-6.jpg</fanart6>					<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2362-7.jpg</fanart7>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2362-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/242737-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172292-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/190234-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56898-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/205846-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2362-1.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/242752-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/87781-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/172293-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/129191-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268794-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268795-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro-2.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268796-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-professor.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268797-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-inside-your.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268798-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-stats-screen.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268799-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-searching.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268800-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-your-usual.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268801-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-finding.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/268802-pokemon-crystal-version-game-boy-color-screenshot-cherrygrove.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2362-g.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Pokemon - Gold Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)">					<description>Pokemon - Gold Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced)</description>					<rom crc="6BDE3C3E" name="Pokemon - Gold Version (USA, Europe) (SGB Enhanced).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>Enter a whole new world, with new Pokmon to capture, train and battle!

Each table has its own details and gameplay elements.Each table has different &quot;locations&quot; that you play, which determine which Pokmon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select your starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game.&quot;Catch Mode,&quot; when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you can attempt to capture a Pokmon. Once you activate &quot;catch mode,&quot; you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokmon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokmon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.&quot;Evolution Mode,&quot; when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokmon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokdex. Once you select a Pokmon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokmon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokmon.</plot>					<genre>PuzzleShooter</genre>					<releasedate>06/28/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8639-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/7755-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48503-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69882-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8639-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/7756-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/144512-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/48504-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56206-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69883-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128922-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128923-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-screenshot-options-menu-starring.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128924-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-screenshot-choosing-the-play.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/606626-pokemon-pinball-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen-sgb.jpg</snapshot4>			</game>			<game name="Pokemon Puzzle Challenge (USA)">					<description>Pokemon Puzzle Challenge (USA)</description>					<rom crc="D06BBA96" name="Pokemon Puzzle Challenge (USA).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>In a rising pit of colored blocks, it's your task to continuously eliminate these tiles by switching two tiles' positions on the horizontal row. When three or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear. Gravity kicks in and settles the rest of the tiles into the bin ? this can cause a chain reaction to occur since other blocks of the same color can fall into place next to each other. It's up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That's the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers busy. In the game's Challenge mode, for example, you're up against a computer opponent and you'll have to make combos and chain reactions to send garbage blocks to his unseen screen -- but keep in mind your opponent's doing the same to you.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<releasedate>12/04/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19067-1.png</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/243948-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69867-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/242708-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/264213-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69868-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/69869-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart7>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86508-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86510-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86511-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86512-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-choose-your.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86513-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-marathon.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86514-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-adventure.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86515-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-adventure.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/86516-pokemon-puzzle-challenge-game-boy-color-screenshot-adventure.jpg</snapshot8>			</game>			<game name="Pokemon Trading Card Game (USA) (SGB Enhanced)">					<description>Pokemon Trading Card Game (USA) (SGB Enhanced)</description>					<rom crc="81069D53" name="Pokemon Trading Card Game (USA) (SGB Enhanced).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Your goal in life is to become a Pokemon Card Master. In order to do that, you must pick a deck from three starter packs of cards based on Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur and travel to the eight card clubs and defeat their leaders. Along the way, you will challenge many players to collect new cards and the helpful Professor Mason will aid you by giving you cards as well. While becoming a card master is a laudable accomplishment, the real goal of the game is to collect all of the cards over 200 in all. If you want to collect all of the cards, you must play human opponents in the Pop mode to get a chance to earn rare cards. All of the complexity of the real-world game has been captured here.

On the Glacier level, two penguins waddle around between the paddles and affect the trajectory of the ball when it hits them. In the Soccer level, players must maneuver two paddles to try to put the ball into the opponent's net. Finally, the Jungle stage has two rollers in the middle that can change the ball's trajectory.

You progress through the game by challenging a certain amount of people before the next event is triggered. Then special events pop up throughout the game after this number is met which usually involve a tournament or beating some strong boss-type character.</plot>					<genre>FightingRole-Playing</genre>					<releasedate>12/01/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8643-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8643-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476001-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-language-selection.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476002-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen-and-main.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476003-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476004-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-at-the-model-shop.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476005-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-choosing-a-model-fighter.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476006-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-at-home-in-your-room.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476007-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-status-and-password.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476008-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-town-overview-you-can.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476009-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-our-first-opponent.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/476010-power-quest-game-boy-color-screenshot-fight.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/8643-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Power Rangers - Lightspeed Rescue (USA, Europe)">					<description>Power Rangers - Lightspeed Rescue (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="99869172" name="Power Rangers - Lightspeed Rescue (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>The Power Rangers have decided to take a more active role in their hometown of Mariner Bay.

Of course, the brilliant sense of humor from the cartoon series is present throughout the adventure, as are all of the other characters you've come to love. Handheld video games just don't get much more creative (or fun) than this.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>02/27/2001</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8642-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8642-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/158781-the-powerpuff-girls-battle-him-game-boy-color-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/8642-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Powerpuff Girls, The - Paint the Townsville Green (USA) (Rev A)">					<description>Powerpuff Girls, The - Paint the Townsville Green (USA) (Rev A)</description>					<rom crc="295B3646" name="Powerpuff Girls, The - Paint the Townsville Green (USA) (Rev A).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>The Powerpuff Girls return to the Game Boy Color with their second game, POWERPUFF GIRLS: Paint the Townsville Green.

Choose one of three different monsters (each a gargantuan tower of rage), and then join your counterparts as you wreak holy terror on city after city. You'll stomp buildings, crush cars, and even take down innocent pedestrians in your strides to do as much damage as possible. Parents can rest assured: although the game's focus is on tearing apart the scenery, there's little of the blood and gore that pervades many video games these days. There are more than 130 stages to romp through in this tribute to silver screen terrors, and each level presents all-new challenges and more difficult gameplay. If you're familiar with the RAMPAGE series, you'll love the inclusion of three new monsters to take the place of the familiar faces from the original game. The play is faithful to previous titles in the RAMPAGE series, but improved graphics and controls make for the most exhilarating entry to date.

There are five mini-games to play; some are versions of classic kid's games, but with a fire theme. One is simple game MEMORY where players must match pictures of animals to rescue them from a fire, while another is similar to SIMON where players must memorize and repeat color combinations. Some of the other games are more action oriented and will challenge anyone's skill. For example, one game calls for the player to ride a jet ski to rescue people stuck on the other side of a river and drop buckets of water from a helicopter. If you have a Game Boy printer, the medals and awards earned can be printed.

There are three pad configurations to choose from.The player also acts as the manager, with options to change the formation, and to call several sets in-play, such as offside traps and the number of players in a free-kick wall.</plot>					<genre>Simulation, Sports</genre>					<releasedate>2000</releasedate>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286454-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286452-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-choose-a-language.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286453-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286455-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286456-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-choose-your-team.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286457-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-three-on-one.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286458-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-brazil-is-my.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286459-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-kick-off.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286460-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-throw-in.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/286461-ronaldo-v-football-game-boy-color-screenshot-penalty-box.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Rugrats - Time Travelers (USA, Europe)">					<description>Rugrats - Time Travelers (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="9C743F03" name="Rugrats - Time Travelers (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>The Rugrats are about to find out that the only thing more exciting than traveling through your own backyard is traveling through time.

As another stroke of luck, there are hollow trees that provide a comfortable place to take a nap.

Playing the game gives the player the same feel as watching the cartoon show with Taz's signature twist and amusing moments. Presented in a 2D look, the graphics, and scenes on every level have a colorfully appealing view from the top down over the game play. Taz must embark on a mission to save his friend, Wendal T. Wolf from Bull Gator and his crony, Axl. Taz ventures away from his home in Tasmania and must pass through the Amazon Jungle, Amsterdam, Switzerland, the Greek Islands, China, Australia, and more. Those familiar with Taz's character on the Looney Tunes cartoons will recognize the fact that Taz hasn't lost his taste for strange and unusual objects as his food source and continues with that practice in his game. Taz literally has to eat his way through each level in order to advance to the next level.

Developed by Japanese studio Natsume, gameplay allows several types of grinds that can link combos on the game's infinite rails, and aerial tricks are nearly as detailed as their 32-bit home boys. GBC owners can choose from 12 professional skaters and skate through seven different locations. No battery save, but the password save system supports the Game Boy Printer for easier logging.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>11/01/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22103-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20572-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20573-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/279869-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart4>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142787-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142788-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-menu-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142789-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-selecting.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178060-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-the-skateboard.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178063-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-bob-burnquist.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178067-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-steve-cabellero.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178069-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-2-game-boy-color-screenshot-elissa.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (USA, Europe)">					<description>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="FD5290A1" name="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>If extreme sports games are your thing, you just can't beat the intense action and wicked tricks of the TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER titles. Graced by incredible graphics and video effects, this chapter goes where none of the previous installments dared to go: Canada. Taking the excitement to the farthest reaches of the globe, PRO SKATER 3 also journeys to Rhode Island, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Rio, and Paris, among others. There are literally hundreds of combos and moves to pull off, and the signature control scheme has actually been improved upon this time out. Whereas previous versions of the game didn't dare leave the skate park, this one forces you to contend with everyday obstacles like pedestrians, traffic, natural disasters, and more. The visual presentation, sound effects, cadre of top-notch professional skaters, and spectrum of tricks has all been improved upon here making for the best TONY HAWK'S PRO SKATER yet.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>11/15/2001</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22104-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20574-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/20575-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142790-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142792-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-screenshot-menu-screen.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142794-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-screenshot-skater.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178083-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-screenshot-tony-hawk.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178084-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-screenshot-kareem.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178085-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-screenshot-bam-margera.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/178088-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-game-boy-color-screenshot-rodney.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="Toobin' (USA)">					<description>Toobin' (USA)</description>					<rom crc="3D6B598C" name="Toobin' (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Race down a river in an inner tube in the arcade classic TOOBIN' on the Game Boy Color.

Fortunately, there are several power-ups scattered throughout the game to help. For example, soda cans are weapons that can be hurled at obstacles to destroy them, patches allow you to recover from collisions, and beach balls grant invulnerability. Figuring out when to use these items is part of the challenge, as you race down 27 different rivers of varying difficulty.

There are five mini-games to play; some are versions of classic kid's games, but with a fire theme. One is simple game MEMORY where players must match pictures of animals to rescue them from a fire, while another is similar to SIMON where players must memorize and repeat color combinations. Some of the other games are more action oriented and will challenge anyone's skill. For example, one game calls for the player to ride a jet ski to rescue people stuck on the other side of a river and drop buckets of water from a helicopter. If you have a Game Boy printer, the medals and awards earned can be printed.

In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels.

The levels itself are relatively open and have to be explored in order in order to find the cats, especially by using Tweety's flutter ability. The player has to tap a button rapidly in order to keep him in the air longer. On the other hand, he has no standard attack and has to use items found in the levels, e.g. banana peels or acorns. The cats have to be overwhelmed with those items to get access to their paws. Of course there are also other enemies which take away a part of Tweety's life energy when touched. There is also a two-player mode in which the participants try to get as many paw imprints as possible in a limited amount of time.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<releasedate>2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1-2s</nplayers>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689419-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689420-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-explaining.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689421-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-training.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689422-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-jump.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689423-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-flying.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689424-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-hit.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689425-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-select.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689426-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-push.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689427-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-collect.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/689428-tweety-s-high-flying-adventure-game-boy-color-screenshot-start.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Tyrian 2000 (USA) (Proto)">					<description>Tyrian 2000 (USA) (Proto)</description>					<rom crc="1FB6B290" name="Tyrian 2000 (USA) (Proto).zip" size="524288"/>					<plot>Professional hockey comes to the Game Boy Color with NHL 2000.

Taking refuge in a cave, he stumbles upon a magical music box. The box sucks him inside, where he comes across an odd fellow who claims to have been the ruler of the music box world. He cannot regain control until he finds five small music boxes. Wario agrees to help find the boxes in exchange for all of the treasure he can find and a ticket out of the music box. You take control of the invincible Wario as he travels throughout the kingdom. Even though Wario is invincible, enemies still pose a problem. When a bad guy hits him, Wario will be afflicted with some temporary effect. Utilizing these side effects is key to solving some of the game's more challenging puzzles.

Early one morning, she and a few of her soldiers, the Pirate Gooms (Spearmen, which are holdovers from Wario Land; several different levels deal with defeating a giant Spearman), sneak into Wario's Castle and cause havoc. They steal his precious treasure, set off his giant alarm clock, and leave the tap running, flooding much of his castle. After Wario wakes up and figures out what's going on, he gives chase across the surrounding lands.The game is noteworthy for several unique features. Unlike most video games of the time, Wario is fully invincible throughout the course of the game, and will not lose lives. The game's challenge comes mostly through impeding player progress by implementing physical obstacles, puzzle-solving, paths blocked by coin or treasure locks, or forcing Wario back to previously-visited areas. By finding hidden exits in some stages, the player can change the direction of the game's plot (loose as it is) and uncover different endings, as well as find more treasure. In addition to the Really Final Chapter, five other endings can be unlocked by collecting all the treasures. An enemy-themed Simon Says minigame based on the Game &amp; Watch game Flagman can be unlocked by collecting all the picture tiles.</plot>					<genre>PlatformPuzzle</genre>					<releasedate>03/31/1999</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8661-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/44530-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/160121-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/61853-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart4>					<boxart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8661-1.jpg</boxart5>					<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/44531-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart6>					<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/44532-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart7>					<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/160120-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart8>					<boxart9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/47772-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-media.jpg</boxart9>					<boxart10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/61854-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart10>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146836-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-start-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146837-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-three-suspicious-characters.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146842-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-after-stealing-his.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146834-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-our-hero-sleeps-uncomfortably.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146835-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-chapter-start.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146845-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-crouching-on-a-turtle.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146846-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-have-a-giant-owl-fly.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146850-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-watch-out-for-these.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146851-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-if-they-get-you-they.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146852-wario-land-ii-game-boy-color-screenshot-these-pelicans-will.jpg</snapshot10>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/8661-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Warlocked (USA)">					<description>Warlocked (USA)</description>					<rom crc="CFA0DF0F" name="Warlocked (USA).zip" size="2097152"/>					<plot>Play as either Humans or Beasts as you plot battle strategies.

All of the other wrestlers have conspired against you, kidnapped Stephanie McMahon, and stolen the WWF Heavyweight Title belt. Choose to play as the Rock, Triple H, the Undertaker, or Stone Cold Steve Austin in this story-based wrestling game. You'll roam the streets, taking down thugs and seeking out valuable information along your journey to redemption. There'll be plenty of objects to pick up and throw, scenery to destroy, and havoc to wreak, but the only weapons you'll be given are your own bare fists and a solid pair of boots. Other weapons (steel pipes, cakes, and mailboxes) are available, though you'll have to defeat a few foes to earn them. Tons of power-ups are strewn throughout the game, but you'll be lucky if you can free up the time and energy to get to them. Awesome graphics, tough boss characters, and a great story make this one unique wrestling title.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<releasedate>08/07/2001</releasedate>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22124-1.jpg</boxart1>					<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149266-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-front-cover.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149267-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-back-cover.jpg</boxart3>					<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/745035-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/745036-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-screenshot-select-a-superstar.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/368120-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-screenshot-a-chesty-fellow.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/368121-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-screenshot-an-awkward-situation.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/745037-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-screenshot-kicking-a-worthless.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/745038-wwf-betrayal-game-boy-color-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot6>			</game>			<game name="WWF WrestleMania 2000 (USA, Europe)">					<description>WWF WrestleMania 2000 (USA, Europe)</description>					<rom crc="FCBA12AE" name="WWF WrestleMania 2000 (USA, Europe).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Get all of the body slams and flying elbows you can handle with WWF WRESTLEMANIA 2000 for the Game Boy Color.

Players may be able to attain higher speeds or even become invincible.</plot>					<genre>SandboxSports</genre>					<releasedate>06/28/2000</releasedate>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/16783-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/16783-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/16783-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/16783-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/734230-xtreme-sports-game-boy-color-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/734231-xtreme-sports-game-boy-color-screenshot-fin-and-guppi-hear.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/734232-xtreme-sports-game-boy-color-screenshot-select-your-character.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/734250-xtreme-sports-game-boy-color-screenshot-guppi-arrives-on-xtreme.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/745039-xtreme-sports-game-boy-color-screenshot-let-s-practice.jpg</snapshot8>					<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/745040-xtreme-sports-game-boy-color-screenshot-choose-an-event.jpg</snapshot9>					<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/745041-xtreme-sports-game-boy-color-screenshot-event-surfing-track.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Xtreme Wheels (USA)">					<description>Xtreme Wheels (USA)</description>					<rom crc="129465DB" name="Xtreme Wheels (USA).zip" size="1048576"/>					<plot>Are you bad enough to handle the best? The world's top BMX racers are ready to take you on, and you have no choice but to answer the call. You'll start at the bottom of the rankings, trying to work your way up the ladder by mastering 20 grueling courses and nailing difficult tricks. The object is to earn as many licenses as possible, which will earn you the right to compete in higher classes. Needless to say, the competition will get smarter and quicker as you advance through the ranks, so you'll need to bring your sharpest skills to the table. There are four different classes to stretch your abilities, and you can actually earn new riders by notching a few victories. XTREME WHEELS is packed with varied hills, jumps, and terrain, so you might want to start off in Exclusive Training mode to get a grip on the handling and realistic physics that the game engine delivers.

Fortunately, you have an unlimited supply of missiles to destroy the shield, or you can fly into the shield and eat a brick. Once there is an opening in the shield, touch the Qotile base with the Yar to activate the Zorlon Cannon. Once activated, you can fire the cannon to destroy the base.

Jellystone Park is holding a Balloon Fest and Yogi Bear (that's you!) knows this is the perfect opportunity to grab hold of some delicious picnic baskets. But first you need to clear the skies of a ton of fast-moving, falling balloons. Guide Yogi across the bottom of the screen, sending balloons shooting upwards from your special picnic basket. The object is to align three balloons of the same color together. When you do, all three pop and disappear, your score goes up, and more balloons drop down. Clear the whole stack before they reach the ground or it's game over. If you're quick and clever, you can cause high-scoring chain reaction explosions that will make your job a little easier. When you feel ready, you can go head-to-head against a friend in Link cable mode.

Make your way across each side-scrolling level, trying to keep your energy up by eating Goobleberries. If you don't eat enough, you'll run out of energy and fall asleep losing one turn. Collecting 100 Goobleberries will earn you an extra shot at completing the game, but that won't be easy with so many other tasks to keep your mind on.
