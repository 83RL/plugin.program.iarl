Second available source.The Nintendo Entertainment System (also abbreviated as NES or simply called Nintendo) is an 8-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in North America during 1985, in Europe during 1986 and Australia in 1987. In most of Asia, including Japan (where it was first launched in 1983), China, Vietnam, Singapore, the Middle East and Hong Kong, it was released as the Family Computer, commonly shortened as either the romanized contraction Famicom, or abbreviated to FC. In South Korea, it was known as the Hyundai Comboy, and was distributed by Hynix which then was known as Hyundai Electronics. As the best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983, and set the standard for subsequent consoles of its generation. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute software for Nintendo's platform.Developer:  NintendoManufacturer:  NintendoCPU:  Ricoh 2A03Memory:  2KB RAMGraphics:  RP2C02Sound:  Pulse Code ModulationDisplay:  RGBMedia:  CartridgeMax.

The player does not select plays for either offense or defense. On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to one of two running backs, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Taito</studio>					<releasedate>10/18/1985</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/317-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/317-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/317-2.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/317-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/317-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/317-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/317.png</clearlogo1>					</game>			<game name="1943 - The Battle of Midway (USA)">					<description>1943 - The Battle of Midway (USA)</description>					<rom crc="12c6d5c7" name="1943 - The Battle of Midway (USA).zip" sha1="1E76A86398F069DA43B25351EF419BE664D630C5" size="131072"/>					<videoid>AHnUzNUsKuc</videoid>					<plot>The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll.

Each world is divided into different quadrants, and the player must pass through each quadrant before the time counter on the bottom of the game screen reaches zero. In each quadrant, the player can find pillar-like columns that house power-ups, objects that are beneficial or add extra abilities to the game character. At the end of each world's last quadrant is a serpent-like creature which must be defeated to advance. A status bar at the bottom of the screen displays the player's score, the time counter, the world number, the world quadrant, the number of bonus stars (items that increase the player's score count) collected by the player, and the number of lives, or continues, remaining.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Acclaim</studio>					<releasedate>09/12/1987</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/315-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/315-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/315-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/315-1.jpg</snapshot1>					</game>			<game name="720 Degrees (USA)">					<description>720 Degrees (USA)</description>					<rom crc="49f745e0" name="720 Degrees (USA).zip" sha1="57690BE45879AA00DD825B89FC525E31FDC041FF" size="131072"/>					<plot>The game begins with the player controlling a skateboarder skating around a middle-class neighborhood using common objects as ramps for jumps.The player begins with a number of &quot;tickets,&quot; each of which granting admission to one of four skate parks, or &quot;events,&quot; in Skate City, the &quot;hub&quot; between the parks. When a park is entered, one ticket is expended. The player gains additional tickets from earning points. Whenever the player isn't in an event, a bar counts down the time remaining until the arrival of deadly, skateboarder-hungry killer bees. Once the bees arrive the player still has a small amount of time with which to get to a park, but the longer the player delays this the faster the bees become, until they are unavoidable. Getting caught by the bees ends the game, though on default settings the player may elect to continue his game by inserting more money. Reaching a park with a ticket gives the player the chance to earn points, medals and money with which to upgrade his equipment, and resets the timer.The player is constantly racing to perform stunts, both in the events and in the park itself, in order to earn the points needed to acquire tickets. Thus, the players score is directly tied to the amount of time he has to play the game. In order to win, the player must complete a total of sixteen events through four hubs, a difficult task.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Mindscape</studio>					<releasedate>11/01/1989</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/22196-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/22196-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/22196-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/22196-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>o087gwEhOdM</videoid>					</game>			<game name="8 Eyes (USA)">					<description>8 Eyes (USA)</description>					<rom crc="326ab3b6" name="8 Eyes (USA).zip" sha1="C74D5CD42C2D29B3358A59FD66757EB00B130A75" size="262144"/>					<videoid>S65SjcsLQ64</videoid>					<plot>8 Eyes is set in a post-apocalyptic future.

Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost.

Two power-ups can help improve Marty's control: bowling balls that can destroy enemies and a skateboard which can speed up gameplay. There are also three minigames at the end of each stage, featuring such scenarios as Marty repelling Biff Tannen's gang of bullies from a cafe, blocking all the kisses Lorraine sends Marty (in the shape of little hearts), and having to position his guitar properly to stay in tune at the dance in order for George and Lorraine to kiss.

Baseball Stars was a critical success, often referred to as the best baseball game on the NES platform (and possibly of all-time); as such it became a franchise series for SNK, spawning five sequels, and its &quot;create player&quot; and &quot;create team&quot; functions have become standard features in sports games.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>SNK</studio>					<releasedate>07/01/1989</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1635-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1635-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1635-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1635-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>Yb9ZF7YaYzY</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Baseball Stars II (USA)">					<description>Baseball Stars II (USA)</description>					<rom crc="18a9f0d9" name="Baseball Stars II (USA).zip" sha1="2F8A9FD8CB6BB23E6C6285C2999A7D6E6B8CD686" size="393216"/>					<plot>Baseball Stars 2 is a 2-player baseball arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console.  A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the &quot;Power connect&quot; graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in &quot;View Team&quot; does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Romstar</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1992</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7816-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7816-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7816-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/7816-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7816.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>hbhNA8DFwkQ</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Bases Loaded (USA)">					<description>Bases Loaded (USA)</description>					<rom crc="b4241fcc" name="Bases Loaded (USA).zip" sha1="4F6F7340B707EB50F1BD989157A201FC98A29FED" size="327680"/>					<plot>The game allows the player to control one of 12 teams in either a single game or a full season. For single games, there is also a two-player option.Bases Loaded featured a unique television-style depiction of the pitcher-batter matchup, as well as strong play control and a relatively high degree of realism, which made it one of the most popular baseball games of the early NES.One unique feature of the game is that the pitcher can provoke a batter to charge the mound. Each team has only one batter (usually the team's best hitter) who can be provoked in this manner, however; it is up to the player to discover who it is.At the time Bases Loaded was released, few video games were licensed by major league sports.

It was developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim.  The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a &quot;cross country&quot; race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Acclaim</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1647-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1647-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1647-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1647-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>U9Owt2F2Lek</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure (USA)">					<description>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure (USA)</description>					<rom crc="c4b6ed3c" name="Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure (USA).zip" sha1="E39CA4477D3B96E1CE3A1C61D8055187EA5F1784" size="262144"/>					<plot>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Video Game Adventure is an action-adventure video game that is part of the Bill &amp; Ted franchise and is based on the film Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure that was released in North America by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991.  The game's plot is not an adaptation of the movie, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film's events.  The story begins when Rufus summons Bill S. Preston Esq. and &quot;Ted&quot; Theodore Logan for a mission.  Both boys arrive at different times; first Ted then Bill.  They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.  Ted will also do the same for Bill's search after he has found a historical figure.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>LJN, Ltd.</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1648-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1648-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1648-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1648-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>A-59JXtgIUo</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge (USA)">					<description>Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge (USA)</description>					<rom crc="847d672d" name="Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge (USA).zip" sha1="283CFF70A55EECAA61A4CB4046A910F7EB3AA062" size="393216"/>					<plot>Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge is a simulation of the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, and thus operates like a racing game.  The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.  Players could chose to run single races at each track or run for the season championship.  The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races.  In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks.  In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.  Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.  Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen.  Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.  However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1649-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1649-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1649-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1649-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>m-6LXN4T2j0</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Bionic Commando (USA)">					<description>Bionic Commando (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d2574720" name="Bionic Commando (USA).zip" sha1="C82E29639E2DFFA2754149025C6784EB2587B09D" size="262144"/>					<plot>Bionic Commando takes place ten years after an unspecified World War between two warring factions.

The objective in each round of the tournament is to catch the largest billfish.  These fish include blue marlin, black marlin, striped marlin, swordfish and sailfish.  Other fish that can be caught include dorado, barracuda, tuna and sharks.  As the player fights fish, there may be several events that occur that the player must respond to, such as a smoking reel or a marlin attempting to tangle the line in the propeller.  Other events are static, such as the fish biting off the line or the fish becoming exhausted.  Each of these events changes the dynamics of the fight, such as changing how much line the fish has or how tired the fish is.  There are three attributes that the player can increase as they fight more and more fish.  These are Muscle Power (ability to pull in heavier fish), Body Strength (ability to fight a fish longer) and Skill (ability to respond to events properly).  The Blue Marlin features a password system to save the player's progress.  A password is generated at the end of every tournament round, and after the tournament is completed (with the player victorious). If the player uses this password to begin a new tournament, they can start over with all of their attributes from their previous game.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Hot B</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1652-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>y6nihjO1NtM</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Blues Brothers, The (USA)">					<description>Blues Brothers, The (USA)</description>					<rom crc="9f2eef20" name="Blues Brothers, The (USA).zip" sha1="AC3F180C7CCB6EA35D24658B315E5AFA72904F74" size="131072"/>					<plot>The characters have the ability to pick up objects (generally boxes) and either put them down to stand on them, or throw them at enemies.

An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's &quot;Kenrip&quot; being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Data East, Mindscape</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7822-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7822-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7822-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/7822-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>BA1v7TWECks</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Bomberman (USA)">					<description>Bomberman (USA)</description>					<rom crc="db9dcf89" name="Bomberman (USA).zip" sha1="D2BF7BD570430902114F1E3393F1FEB8B1C76E4D" size="24576"/>					<plot>Bomberman is an action game that has become synonymous with the Hudson brand.

After being accused of robbing a bank, White Bomberman is thrown in jail. Bomberman's mission is to escape his prison cell and bring Black Bomberman to justice.The game follows the classic Bomberman formula: you are in a room full of blocks and enemies and Bomberman must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies. Several blocks contain power-ups (such as blast radius increasers or fuse shorteners), and one in each level contains a door, which takes Bomberman to the next level.Passwords are given after game over, recording the level, number of bombs, and strength of bombs. These passwords can be entered when the game starts allowing the player to continue where he left off.New to the series are the multi-player modes. Vs Mode is a 2-player mode, while Battle Mode is a 3-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs. An NES Four Score is required to play the 3-player mode.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>3</nplayers>					<studio>Hudson Soft</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1992</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1653-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1653-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1653-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1653-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1653-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>ar_Kr_UKQ0Y</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Bonk's Adventure (USA)">					<description>Bonk's Adventure (USA)</description>					<rom crc="4e44ff44" name="Bonk's Adventure (USA).zip" sha1="68837B38CFCB50EF4DA5AF50BFCE3F216945D745" size="393216"/>					<plot>The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies.  Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by &quot;bonking&quot; them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small &quot;smiley&quot; power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>NEC Home Electronics</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1994</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1654-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1654-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1654-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1654-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1654.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>_Vj6R1QEoi8</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Boulder Dash (USA)">					<description>Boulder Dash (USA)</description>					<rom crc="a8f4d99e" name="Boulder Dash (USA).zip" sha1="A856DB911542DC835DB7CE67DAD3E159BD7A637F" size="65536"/>					<plot>The game's protagonist is called &quot;Rockford&quot;.

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected throughout the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000, and 3000 points, and so on) which results in more lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.Enemies turn &quot;angry&quot;  becoming pink-colored and moving faster  if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long, or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen. However, this is a rare occurrence.After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost.Contact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) is deadly, resulting in the loss of a life.The game's music was written by Japanese team Zuntata. Peter Clarke, Tim Follin and David Whittaker have arranged music for home computer ports (some versions have a new intro music by Whittaker).</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Taito</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7824-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7824-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7824-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7824-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7824-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/7824-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/7824.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>O49OgQ_kogw</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Bubble Bobble Part 2 (USA)">					<description>Bubble Bobble Part 2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="e095c3f2" name="Bubble Bobble Part 2 (USA).zip" sha1="19783C0724A495316FFA54F5D85A5729D6FE637E" size="262144"/>					<plot>For both the NES and Game Boy versions, the gameplay remains largely unchanged from the other games in the series.

The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.Two players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.The arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Milton Bradley Company</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1989</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1660-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1660-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1660-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1660-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1660.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>1CDUTq4c-EU</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Caesars Palace (USA)">					<description>Caesars Palace (USA)</description>					<rom crc="db1d03e5" name="Caesars Palace (USA).zip" sha1="D6F0E6BEB129D5E4591B9FF81A5CF895A134245E" size="131072"/>					<plot>This game allows you to play in the Caesars Palace casino.

As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes from each of the four levels.The first four levels include The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The Clouds. During each level you can collect 'I' icons that give you temporary invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, 'Sunshine' icons to restore your health, and 'Raisinette' icons to give an extra life to the player.

Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Hewson Consultants, U.S. Gold, Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>05/01/1991</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1243-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1243-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1243-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1243-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1243-g.jpg</banner1>					<videoid>ZXVy6XumttI</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Castle of Dragon (USA)">					<description>Castle of Dragon (USA)</description>					<rom crc="2f2d1fa9" name="Castle of Dragon (USA).zip" sha1="FFA15151EB16AFF9618FA99E159FADE06EB46F2B" size="131072"/>					<plot>The Dragon Master, Darklarza, has been terrorizing the kingdom for numerous years.

This will take him right to that level's boss battle.Bonus levels include such fun things as guiding a bear to jump over flames, avoiding boulders in a car, using Rodan as target practice and meeting Godzilla at the circus grounds.</plot>					<genre>ActionPlatform</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Toho</studio>					<releasedate>07/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1673-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1673-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1673-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1673-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>UUubmc1lCQQ</videoid>					</game>			<game name="City Connection (USA)">					<description>City Connection (USA)</description>					<rom crc="ae8666b4" name="City Connection (USA).zip" sha1="D77B46806992AE91681791747EC812938A6A185E" size="65536"/>					<plot>The main character in the game is a female driver, Clarice, of a Honda City (the North American version features a male driver) on a tour of all the sights and roads across the world. To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car &quot;explodes&quot; by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to &quot;explode&quot;) with playing of a comical music, &quot;Der Flohwalzer&quot;, known as &quot;Neko Funjatta&quot; (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car &quot;explode&quot; on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the &quot;catchy&quot; tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city. Although it uses &quot;ethnic&quot; variations according to the destination, it's an adaptation of a famous classic piece, &quot;Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso&quot;, from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.</plot>					<genre>PlatformRacing</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Jaleco / Kitcorp</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1985</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1674-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1674-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1674-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1674-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>cZ1oA-QBflI</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Clash at Demonhead (USA)">					<description>Clash at Demonhead (USA)</description>					<rom crc="82afa828" name="Clash at Demonhead (USA).zip" sha1="49B60CEAA9AF08C5179103380BCFFBEF6288EEB5" size="262144"/>					<plot>Clash at Demonhead is an open-ended platformer.

Two players can play against each other, or one person can play against a computer generated opponent. The answer to the puzzle is hidden by tiles. The tiles have words denoting game prizes (&quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Camera&quot;, &quot;Telescope&quot;, for example) and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles.

Each series of five generally contains one of each type of mission. The fifth are generally the boss stages. The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are &quot;Turbo&quot; (increase the speed of the boat), &quot;Fire&quot; (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), &quot;Speed&quot; (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), &quot;Missile&quot; (improves missiles) and &quot;Force&quot; (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or enemy fire.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>07/01/1988</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1677-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1677-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1677-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1677-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1677-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1677-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1677-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<videoid>PWshFqnMjZM</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Code Name - Viper (USA)">					<description>Code Name - Viper (USA)</description>					<rom crc="e2313813" name="Code Name - Viper (USA).zip" sha1="220939191A48FB2CF3A73C8FD713A60AD2EE34DF" size="262144"/>					<plot>The player takes the role of Kenny Smith, an agent of the 98th Special Forces, also known as &quot;Code Name: Viper&quot;, who is assigned by his commander, Director Jones, to investigate a large drug syndicate that covers all of South America.

It is based upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s. The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.There are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of &quot;Konami Man&quot;, who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7827-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7827-1.jpg</boxart1>					</game>			<game name="Crash 'n' the Boys - Street Challenge (USA)">					<description>Crash 'n' the Boys - Street Challenge (USA)</description>					<rom crc="c7f0c457" name="Crash 'n' the Boys - Street Challenge (USA).zip" sha1="6F1112340AF9899BAE7CCEABCF65C5E3492F6577" size="262144"/>					<plot>Theodore &quot;Todd&quot; Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff &quot;Crash&quot; Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>American Technos</studio>					<releasedate>10/01/1992</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7828-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7828-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7828-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/7828-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>X_vP3K1UlvU</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Cross Fire (USA) (Proto)">					<description>Cross Fire (USA) (Proto)</description>					<rom crc="bee30c5f" name="Cross Fire (USA) (Proto).zip" sha1="7BF96EFA5A412E9E3183EF022F673C924106BBCC" size="262144"/>					<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/3/6/42136_back.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/1/3/6/42136_front.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/5/2/gfs_20837_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>j6fYFsn8cgA</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Crystalis (USA)">					<description>Crystalis (USA)</description>					<rom crc="1335cb05" name="Crystalis (USA).zip" sha1="8A49FE60B6A151C055A63639894CD366935A7EE9" size="393216"/>					<plot>Crystalis takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, one hundred years after a global thermonuclear war has reverted civilization to a primitive, medieval existence populated with fierce mutated creatures.

The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from &quot;cool&quot; to &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;, and &quot;critical&quot; status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to &quot;cool&quot; by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Atari Games</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1684-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1684-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1684-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1684.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>oOMAy0A3yZQ</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Cybernoid - The Fighting Machine (USA)">					<description>Cybernoid - The Fighting Machine (USA)</description>					<rom crc="ac8dcdea" name="Cybernoid - The Fighting Machine (USA).zip" sha1="DF3B2EC1EE818DA7C57672A82E76D9591C9D9DC1" size="65536"/>					<plot>In Cybernoid, pirates have raided the storage depots of the Federation and stolen minerals, jewels, ammunition and the latest battle weaponry.

Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level.

It was released for the ZX Spectrum, NES, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. It was also ported to the Game Boy and Atari ST. The game's plot is loosely based on the film of the same name. In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face. In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film and takes place on a skyscraper under construction. After the player defeats their mirror image five times and wipes out the mob cartel that scarred Darkman, the final boss is inexplicably a clone of Darkman himself.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Ocean Software</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/7829-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/7829-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7829-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>1RyyRUwVHT8</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Darkwing Duck (USA)">					<description>Darkwing Duck (USA)</description>					<rom crc="5dce2eea" name="Darkwing Duck (USA).zip" sha1="5AAD6D1022C7EA13F69056A5A64FCF4C7BB737A6" size="262144"/>					<plot>The kingpins of crime are at it again!

This was due to polygonal graphics being used as opposed to sprites, rendering the car, track, and trackside details in untextured 3D polygons.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Mindscape</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1689-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1689-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1689-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>EbgxK4fOnOo</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Deadly Towers (USA)">					<description>Deadly Towers (USA)</description>					<rom crc="c2730c30" name="Deadly Towers (USA).zip" sha1="764C9A41DB58D9A0F8DD56499CF1EA84C10ADDF8" size="131072"/>					<plot>On the moonlit eve of his coronation ceremony, pensive Prince Myer sits at the lakeside to ponder the future of the kingdom.

Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Kemco</studio>					<releasedate>06/01/1989</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1692-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1692-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1692-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1692-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>u4TFwMj4xf8</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Destination Earthstar (USA)">					<description>Destination Earthstar (USA)</description>					<rom crc="eb9960ee" name="Destination Earthstar (USA).zip" sha1="CFB0DC557FDC913B995EE8B848C84F2661260E5F" size="65536"/>					<plot>The view of the game is from the cockpit of a spacecraft. The goal of the game is to explore a grid which is displayed on screen in search of opponents to destroy and to land on planets some of which refuel the energy and refill ammo to the player's arsenal of weapons which consist of his photon laser. This is his primary weapon while the torpedoes become his second weapon. After the player has destroyed every enemy that is on the grid, a number will be indicated. This number represents how many enemies are in that quadrant of the grid. After blasting numerous enemies, the player will finally be able to go to the planet labeled &quot;B&quot; on the grid. These planets are unlike the other planets as they do not refill the player's vehicles energy or ammo. Rather, they are an enemy base that proceeds with the player entering a 8-bit cutscene of his space craft entering the base's gravitational orbit with the game play changing from a first person cockpit you had on the grid stage to a horizntal 2D shmup stage similar to Konami's Gradius or R-Type.

The objective is to solve several mysteries without accusing the wrong person or shooting too many unarmed villains.Each level starts out with a case to solve, and some possible clues. The player drives Tracy's vehicle through the city, avoiding snipers and other cars, to various locations mentioned in the clues, where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location, he will find, during the course of his side-scrolling fighting, a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case, or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues.

In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the &quot;foot meter&quot;. The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Activision</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1695-2.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1695-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1695-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1695-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1695-g.png</banner1>					<videoid>WV0NCiN2i5c</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Dig Dug II - Trouble in Paradise (USA)">					<description>Dig Dug II - Trouble in Paradise (USA)</description>					<rom crc="dbb06a25" name="Dig Dug II - Trouble in Paradise (USA).zip" sha1="6CF59A2D94DEF6C300CFC350C21ABD85F6B59BEF" size="40960"/>					<plot>DIG DUG has decided to chill out from the pressures of the real world by taking a long overdue vacation on a beautiful Caribbean island. &quot;At last,&quot; he thinks to himself, &quot;sun, sand, surf, and no more hassles from those miserable pests Pooka and Fygar!&quot; Lying in a hammock between the graceful palm trees, he drifts off into a blissful dream of beautiful bikini clad native girls catering to his every wish.

In the first mode, the objective is to enter math answers in order to receive points. These questions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Junior; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challanging, not only the goal is a negative number, but giving players the set number.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1985</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1929-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1929-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1929-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1929-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>QC8CsVszclc</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Double Dare (USA)">					<description>Double Dare (USA)</description>					<rom crc="2b378d11" name="Double Dare (USA).zip" sha1="4B0A6F62A5DF2B6022357AA0C18978798299459B" size="262144"/>					<plot>The video game version of Double Dare played exactly like its television counterpart. Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three  the obstacle course  featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, &quot;Dallas&quot;, Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. &quot;Prizes&quot; for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best &quot;ending&quot; by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>GameTek</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1988</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1698-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1698-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1698-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>FSjruZoQT3g</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Double Dragon (USA)">					<description>Double Dragon (USA)</description>					<rom crc="0f1cc048" name="Double Dragon (USA).zip" sha1="96356DA50FF4CD4E3D399181AC19DAFBF298EEA8" size="262144"/>					<plot>The player takes control of martial artist Billy Lee, or his twin brother Jimmy (also known as Hammer and Spike in the supplementary materials for the American arcade release), as they fight their way into the turf of the Black Warriors gang in order to rescue their common love interest Marian. The player character has a repertoire of martial art techniques which they can perform by using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques ranges from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate maneuvers like hair grabbing moves or elbow punches. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits from enemies. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face thorough the course of the game. Certain enemies will carry a melee weapon which the player can use by disarming the enemy carrying it and then retrieving the item from the floor. The available weapons includes steel bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite sticks, as well as large objects such as cardboard boxes, oil drums, and rocks, which the player can lift and throw at enemies or kick it towards incoming ones.The game is divided into four different stages or &quot;missions&quot;, which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the hideout of the boss. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players manage to complete the game together then the two will be forced to fight each other in order to determine who will win Marian's affections.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1987</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/208-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/208-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/208-2.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/208-2.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/208-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/208-g.jpg</banner1>					<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/208-g2.jpg</banner2>					<banner3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/208-g3.jpg</banner3>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/208.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>uilX4h8sEBg</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Double Dragon II - The Revenge (USA)">					<description>Double Dragon II - The Revenge (USA)</description>					<rom crc="13c774dd" name="Double Dragon II - The Revenge (USA).zip" sha1="FDBF0A18EA677EEC5F7437A80449B033526DD68B" size="262144"/>					<plot>The arcade version of Double Dragon II: The Revenge begins with Marian, the heroine from the original Double Dragon, being shot to death by the leader of the Black Warriors.

As the fighter, the player can run, crouch, jump, and attack with his sword as he would in most side-scrolling action games. Underneath his life gauge is a &quot;metamorphosis gauge&quot; that will gradually be filled as the player destroys his enemies. When the metamorphosis gauge begins to flash, the player can transform into the dragon by pressing up and A button after jumping. As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game. The dragon's main attack is his fire breath. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. While in dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again.As the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player's outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon's fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health.There are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>SOFEL</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1931-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1931-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1931-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1931-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>VmMEjvQiso4</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Dragon Power (USA)">					<description>Dragon Power (USA)</description>					<rom crc="811f06d9" name="Dragon Power (USA).zip" sha1="184D7BA4CCFE4143BBE4B3C793F0A3554BBAEA63" size="163840"/>					<plot>Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988.

The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<studio>Bandai Co., Ltd.</studio>					<releasedate>03/01/1988</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/14278-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/14278-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/14278-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/14278-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>zz5cs5gEVro</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Dragon Spirit - The New Legend (USA)">					<description>Dragon Spirit - The New Legend (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d7e29c03" name="Dragon Spirit - The New Legend (USA).zip" sha1="9DF034FE5A7E451D8BF896EF9E5111D7F428E32B" size="262144"/>					<plot>After a millennium of captivity, an ugly serpent demon named Zawell escapes imprisonment and kidnaps Alicia, princess to the kingdom of Mitgult. A young, crafty soldier Amul is selected to rescue the princess and destroy Zawell. In praying to the gods for strength and courage, he points his sword high toward the heavens. Suddenly he is transformed into an all-powerful blue dragon, bestowed with special powers. Though gifted with a lethal air and ground attack, this is not enough.

The player takes the role of a namable Hero. The Hero's name has an effect on his statistical growth over the course of the game. Battles are fought in a turn-based format and experience points and gold are awarded after every battle, allowing the Hero to level-up in ability and allows them to buy better weapons, armor, and items. Progression consists of traveling over an overworld map and through dungeons, fighting monsters encountered via random battles along the journey.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>05/27/1986</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/345-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/345-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/345-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/345-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/345-g.jpg</banner1>					<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/345-g2.png</banner2>					<videoid>5U5gnCG0AUI</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Dragon Warrior II (USA)">					<description>Dragon Warrior II (USA)</description>					<rom crc="8c5a784e" name="Dragon Warrior II (USA).zip" sha1="191A131E7E27E121D094CC412FED87C708147B2C" size="262144"/>					<plot>This game allows the player to control more than one character, and it is the first one in the Dragon Quest series to do so.

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.Dragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.The remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting &quot;Tidy Item&quot; and &quot;Tidy Bag&quot; commands; and the &quot;Full HP&quot; command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another &quot;major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.&quot;</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Enix</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1700-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1700-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1700-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1700-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>WJSy4g0Daxk</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Dragon Warrior IV (USA)">					<description>Dragon Warrior IV (USA)</description>					<rom crc="506e259d" name="Dragon Warrior IV (USA).zip" sha1="1B3DC265BA0D7E4B2CEF9B3F8B0BE0847DF67C3C" size="524288"/>					<plot>Dragon Quest IV differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists.

Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, &quot;Tores&quot;, used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land.

With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode).

(This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.Just like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.A player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.Once a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.If a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of &quot;Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today&quot;.

It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Acclaim</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1992</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7864-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>w97MjGBuVPw</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Fester's Quest (USA)">					<description>Fester's Quest (USA)</description>					<rom crc="b6bf5137" name="Fester's Quest (USA).zip" sha1="DF3AD62F4503170770FE36FB2BA8840E120F0896" size="262144"/>					<plot>Along the way, Fester encounters other members of the Addams Family: Thing, Wednesday, Morticia, Grandmama, and Pugsley, all of whom help him by giving him different weapons and items.

The player can freely roam an overworld containing several towns and dungeons. A menu-based system allows the player to outfit each character with equipment and up to twooften disposableitems for battle. Magic spells are assigned to the character from the item menu, and certain spells, such as &quot;Cure&quot;, can be used outside of battle. The player can also save their progress on the overworld. Weapons, armor, items, and magic spells can be purchased at shops, and townspeople provide useful information for the player's progression through the game. One new feature is the &quot;Word Memory&quot; system: when in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), the player can &quot;ask&quot; about and &quot;memorize&quot; special keywords or phrases, which can later be repeated to other NPCs to gain more information or unlock new actions. Similarly, there exist a handful of special items that can be shown to NPCs during conversation or used on certain objects, which have the same effect. Characters and monsters are no longer separated into separate windows in the battle screen as they were in Final Fantasy I, and players can see their current and total hit points below the battle. Players can also fight with less than four characters in their party, which was not possible in the first game. Final Fantasy II introduced the chocobo, the signature Final Fantasy mascot, which lets characters ride to a location at great speed without being attacked by enemies. The recurring character Cid was also introduced in II; a character of the same name has appeared in every main-series game since.On the overworld and within dungeons, (that image was banned because it came from a ROM site) random encounters with enemies can be fought to improve each character's attributes. Unlike the original Final Fantasy, players could not upgrade their characters' classes. The game is also one of the few games in the series to not use experience-based levels. Instead, each character participating in battle develops depending on what actions they take. For instance, characters who use a particular type of weapon frequently will become more adept at wielding a weapon of that type, and will also increase in physical strength and accuracy. Attributes include hit points, magic points, magic power, stamina, strength, spirit, agility, intelligence, and evasion. Players can also increase their ability to wield certain types of weapon, and repeated use in combat causes the ability to level up. Hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) increase with their use; a character who takes a heavy amount of damage in a battle might earn an increase in maximum HP, while a character who uses a lot of MP during battle might increase their maximum MP. This experience system had several unintended consequences that allowed characters to gain much more experience than intended, such as players having their characters attack each other and repeatedly cast spells, thus causing their HP and abilities to grow extensively. Final Fantasy II uses the same turn-based battle system seen in the original Final Fantasy, with battle parties consisting of up to four characters at a time. The game introduces a &quot;back row&quot; in battle, within which characters or enemies are immune to most physical attacks, but can be harmed with bows and magical attacks.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Square</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1988</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/7869-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>LmfNGmv8eOw</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Fire 'n Ice (USA)">					<description>Fire 'n Ice (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d534c98e" name="Fire 'n Ice (USA).zip" sha1="1DCA84FC0AA70AA7FBA8384585C4B82D0778BFF4" size="262144"/>					<plot>The aim of the game involves players extinguishing all fires in a level in order to proceed.

There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming &quot;World Tournament of Contact Sports&quot; as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Culture Brain</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1989</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1828-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1828-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>9NUOn0SB6VY</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Flying Warriors (USA)">					<description>Flying Warriors (USA)</description>					<rom crc="10180072" name="Flying Warriors (USA).zip" sha1="4BE0DAF0C891D8020B3B4CD0534B469677932C7A" size="262144"/>					<plot>In an unexplored region of China wrapped in mystery, Ryuhi, a boy, was born and brought up in high mountain tops.

One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming &quot;World Tournament of Contact Sports&quot; as a representative of Shorinji.

Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Culture Brain USA</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1829-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1829-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>Z9O9LWp8Kmw</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Formula One - Built to Win (USA)">					<description>Formula One - Built to Win (USA)</description>					<rom crc="5a8b4da8" name="Formula One - Built to Win (USA).zip" sha1="C3FB75748E0E3D6C4CCE37DBB6BB10573CE117FD" size="262144"/>					<plot>Formula One: Born To Win is a career racing game.

Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).In order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a &quot;chance.&quot; Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Hi Tech Expressions</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1831-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1831-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>0AOwLQIVu5k</videoid>					</game>			<game name="G.I.

At the onset of the game, Jones has just reached the Pankot Palace featured in the movie and is preparing to free the slave children, recover the missing Sankara Stones and defeat Mola Ram and his Thuggee entourage. The game differs from the original arcade version in many respects, including the layout and the manner in which one progresses through the game, but the plot remains unchanged in both versions.The player advances through 12 levels (called &quot;waves&quot;), the first nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may restart the game with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Tengen</studio>					<releasedate>12/01/1988</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1860-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1860-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1860-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1860.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>nArh-9LJ1sA</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Infiltrator (USA)">					<description>Infiltrator (USA)</description>					<rom crc="df64963b" name="Infiltrator (USA).zip" sha1="4CC68474658B796954402FCA71DA5F2FF8BAF5AE" size="262144"/>					<plot>You're Captain Johnny &quot;Jimbo-Baby&quot; McGibbits - The Infiltrator: Ace helicopter pilot, ballistics expert, rock star, motorcycle racer, and all-around good guy.

Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Ocean</studio>					<releasedate>06/01/1993</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2836-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2836-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2836-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2836-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2836-5.jpg</fanart5>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2836-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2836-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>JlonCdEJckQ</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Kabuki - Quantum Fighter (USA)">					<description>Kabuki - Quantum Fighter (USA)</description>					<rom crc="7474ac92" name="Kabuki - Quantum Fighter (USA).zip" sha1="F26B28562F78FC027C0CA8993F70F2F1F75C8D41" size="262144"/>					<plot>The setting - Earth, the future.

The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.</plot>					<genre>Strategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>KOEI</studio>					<releasedate>12/01/1989</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8482-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8482-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/8482-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<videoid>sTV06jd9j3A</videoid>					</game>			<game name="North and South (USA)">					<description>North and South (USA)</description>					<rom crc="ae9f33d0" name="North and South (USA).zip" sha1="AF71701A85A22CFC330A60000E62CA188ECE73E3" size="262144"/>					<plot>Chaaarge!!!

Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people. The basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. In addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include &quot;Attack of the Paint Zombies&quot; (similar to Space Invaders), &quot;The Warehouse Shuffle&quot; (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), &quot;Four Alarm Rescue&quot; (catching people as they jump out of windows), and &quot;Leapin' Energy Casules!&quot; (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship). There are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.</plot>					<genre>Puzzle</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>LJN</studio>					<releasedate>07/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2006-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2006-1.jpg</boxart2>					</game>			<game name="Pin Bot (USA)">					<description>Pin Bot (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d19addeb" name="Pin Bot (USA).zip" sha1="C649505DCE1607ED1B5D201003194629C9C3A86C" size="196608"/>					<boxart1>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/16/PinBot_NES_boxart.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>-AYtvyfiyY0</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Pinball (World)">					<description>Pinball (World)</description>					<rom crc="035dc2e9" name="Pinball (World).zip" sha1="BE348431A9C03D1A588A8363C0094B5A0722D9BE" size="24576"/>					<plot>Be a pinball wizard, right in your own home!   Bank off bumpers, flip double flippers - even win a bonus round - in Nintendo's lightning-fast PINBALL!

The situation is explosive - in fact, it is so bad, a private corporation, O.C.P., has assumed control of the police force. Then, a research team creates an unstoppable, indestructible law enforcement cyborg - named RoboCop. Using a wild assortment of weapons, including RoboCop's Special Issue Auto-9, you must stop every sleazeball criminal you encounter with deadly, piercing accuracy. But beware, there are forces on the street - and within O.C.P. - that will stop at nothing to see RoboCop eliminated. Make your way past 6 levels of street thugs, Boddicker and the powerful ED-209 to your final battle with Dick Jones. Prepare yourself for non-stop action in one of the most explosive games you will ever play.

While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<studio>LJN</studio>					<releasedate>10/01/1991</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/8525-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/8525-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>uD7Nyd2JHu0</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Rollerball (USA)">					<description>Rollerball (USA)</description>					<rom crc="69635a6e" name="Rollerball (USA).zip" sha1="1453664EF61ED1F4C1EA49F0956362472704BB73" size="163840"/>					<plot>ROLLERBALL - The action-packed Pinball Game with the distinctly American touch!

It was one of the simplest-to-play NES games ever released commercially. This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Hi Tech Expressions</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2063-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2063-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>p9786F-hdfs</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Sesame Street 123 (USA)">					<description>Sesame Street 123 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="339437f6" name="Sesame Street 123 (USA).zip" sha1="263B3E3FF9FEBA62B646851FADACA3E1E20B6FC9" size="65536"/>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2063-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2063-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>TS0cCzuN-ek</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Sesame Street ABC (USA)">					<description>Sesame Street ABC (USA)</description>					<rom crc="ec0fc2de" name="Sesame Street ABC (USA).zip" sha1="92AE9BD552B0008EE513FCB63D93F008716472BE" size="65536"/>					<plot>Two great games in one!

In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game actually begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character.The player character can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summononing a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality.The player's default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice-versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally. However, the kusarigama can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthen by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon's strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret powerups hidden in some levels (for example in the central wheel of level 1.3). The player can also obtain shurikens and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long the player's supply lasts before the player reverts back to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions. Something worth mentioning is the fact that the potions being offered in order to heal yourself if played by 2 players will have different colors, which depending if the color of the potion is the same as the character that use it, it will replenish a large amount of health but if the color of the potion is not the same it will heal less.The game consists of five stages, with the first four stages being divided into three segments and the final stage into two. The player will fight numerous types of enemy characters throughout each stage, including bosses and sub-bosses. once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are from it, since actually the same amount of health from one stage will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Taito</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1991</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2070-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2070-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2070-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2070-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2070-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2070-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2070-5.jpg</snapshot5>					</game>			<game name="Shadowgate (USA)">					<description>Shadowgate (USA)</description>					<rom crc="6a1f628a" name="Shadowgate (USA).zip" sha1="E7869C683BD93275CDE4536CD2DDF37F230DD8D0" size="262144"/>					<plot>A hidden key unlocks an ancient castle's door.

Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! &quot;Lettuce check it out,&quot; urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. &quot;I yam King Kale,&quot; he says, &quot;Won't you peas peas help me?&quot; Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before.It seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and &quot;vegetable-themed&quot; guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist.Our two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Jaleco Entertainment</studio>					<releasedate>03/21/1991</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/18788-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/18788-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/18788-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/18788-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/18788-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/18788-4.jpg</snapshot4>					</game>			<game name="Stack-Up (World)">					<description>Stack-Up (World)</description>					<rom crc="df67daa1" name="Stack-Up (World).zip" sha1="85B0031C86274A5805933C5422F7B8DCFAB75134" size="40960"/>					<plot>Stack-Up is an Action game, developed and published by Nintendo, which was released in 1985.In some modes, Professor Hector works with R.O.B. to organize blocks.

Now, he's coming back stronger than ever, with a sinister plan that includes having his intergalactic warriors seep into the brains of the U.S. Army. To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon's eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it's all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world!</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<releasedate>04/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1456-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1456-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1456-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1456-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<videoid>91-LoDomOB8</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Super Cars (USA)">					<description>Super Cars (USA)</description>					<rom crc="419461d0" name="Super Cars (USA).zip" sha1="4F55AFAF521841B3D50F8076BE674321C1CF4623" size="131072"/>					<plot>Super Cars is a Racing game, developed by Gremlin Graphics and published by Electro Brain, which was released in 1991.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<studio>Electro Brain</studio>					<releasedate>02/01/1991</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11770-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>6cohEl3ht2g</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Super Dodge Ball (USA)">					<description>Super Dodge Ball (USA)</description>					<rom crc="689971f9" name="Super Dodge Ball (USA).zip" sha1="7A466684F5928FE656841DF20BCB458E74108239" size="262144"/>					<plot>This ain't elementary school and it sure as heck ain't gym class.

The cart included two games developed by Technos: # Super Spike V'Ball, a two-on-two beach volleyball game where you played on a tournament, ending with the world championship. The game supported up to four players on one match at a time; # Nintendo World Cup, a soccer game where you (and a friend) chose to represent a team and played several matches until you won the World Cup. The game featured little to no rules, which means that you could hit your opponents as much as you want, without fear of the Ref getting in the way.

The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race.

After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet &quot;Stalking&quot; Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Ultra</studio>					<releasedate>12/01/1990</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1427-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1427-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1427-3.jpg</fanart3>					<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1427-4.jpg</fanart4>					<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1427-5.jpg</fanart5>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1427-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1427-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>yaHFwzKXesk</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III - The Manhattan Project (USA)">					<description>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III - The Manhattan Project (USA)</description>					<rom crc="bb6d7949" name="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III - The Manhattan Project (USA).zip" sha1="B3228341C41EDD6751AF37FD3DC83B07899A6D55" size="524288"/>					<plot>Surf's up, dude!

The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.All of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a &quot;tetris&quot;. (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called &quot;Easy Spin&quot; in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)</plot>					<genre>PuzzleStrategy</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Bullet-Proof Software</studio>					<releasedate>07/15/1988</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1424-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1424-2.jpg</fanart2>					<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1424-3.jpg</fanart3>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1424-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1424-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1424-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1424.png</clearlogo1>					<videoid>CvUK-YWYcaE</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Tetris 2 (USA)">					<description>Tetris 2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="9c537919" name="Tetris 2 (USA).zip" sha1="12C64449B7470AECF096B32AD2D19CC62BF99635" size="262144"/>					<plot>Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you clearing the field of blocks in a different way.

There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. Though he was young, he made himself a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming &quot;World Tournament of Contact Sports&quot; as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Culture Brain USA</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1990</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1829-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1829-1.jpg</boxart1>					<videoid>Z9O9LWp8Kmw</videoid>					</game>			<game name="To the Earth (USA)">					<description>To the Earth (USA)</description>					<rom crc="de8fd935" name="To the Earth (USA).zip" sha1="D270AC1F3A07D8526C29FCEE69896FDE8F4DCA5B" size="65536"/>					<plot>In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet!

Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire.

The game is the first in the Babylonian Castle Saga and second chronologically. In 1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed below.Combining hack &amp; slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide. Its hack &amp; slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.The game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game. A noteworthy element of the anime is the music, composed by famed video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.</plot>					<genre>Action</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Namco</studio>					<releasedate>08/06/1985</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/27325-1.jpg</boxart2>					<videoid>uSK1_Ah3p_o</videoid>					</game>			<game name="Town &amp; Country Surf Designs - Thrilla's Surfari (USA)">					<description>Town &amp; Country Surf Designs - Thrilla's Surfari (USA)</description>					<rom crc="7e57fbec" name="Town &amp; Country Surf Designs - Thrilla's Surfari (USA).zip" sha1="EB86CEEFF011B93A81630B0D5118876581BFC72B" size="262144"/>					<plot>Whoa, Thrilla Gorilla!
