Named for its 64-bit CPU, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is Nintendo′s last home console to use ROM cartridges to store games (Nintendo switched to a MiniDVD-based format for the successor GameCube); handhelds in the Game Boy line, however, continued to use Game Paks. It was discontinued in 2001 in Japan, North America and PAL regions by the launch of Nintendo′s GameCube.Developer:  NintendoManufacturer:  NintendoCPU:  93.75 MHz NEC VR4300Memory:  4MB RDRAMGraphics:  62.5 MHz SGI RCPSound:  48 kHz with 16-bit audioDisplay:  480iMedia:  CartridgeMax.

Humanity has been reduced to a few survivors inhabiting the orbital space station Omega. Over the course of the history, aliens visited the Earth every twenty-five years, &quot;harvesting&quot; humans as an organic material. Eventually, they launch an assault on the last remnants of the human race. But Adam Drake, a genetically engineered soldier, comes into possession of a time-traveling device. He uses it to travel to the time periods of human history when aliens performed their deadly attacks. The fate of humanity is in his hands.Body Harvest is an action and driving game with a mission-based structure. The protagonist travels to various locations and eras (e.g. Greece during World War II, Siberia in the 1990s, etc.) with the goal of stopping alien invasions. Missions can be accessed by traveling to specified areas on the map. Adam can move on foot and use his weapons to kill aliens; however, vehicles usually prove to be a more reliable way of tackling most missions. Adam can use most of his weapons while in a vehicle; in addition, some vehicles are outfitted with their own weapons.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooter</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Midway</studio>					<releasedate>10/20/1998</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/244-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/244-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/244-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/244-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/244-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/244-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/244.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bomberman 64 (USA)">					<description>Bomberman 64 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="50a98bdf" name="Bomberman 64 (USA).zip" sha1="DF52CAEA78CC786F896CB14E532088EC9CA6BEA6" size="8388608"/>					<videoid>M452PrfRrGI</videoid>					<plot>In the game's opening sequence, a peaceful-looking planet with gardens, rivers, and residential buildings abound is shown.

Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Fliks harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</plot>					<genre>Adventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Activision</studio>					<releasedate>11/06/1998</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/239-2.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/239-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/239-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/239-2.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/239-g.jpg</banner1>					<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/239-g2.jpg</banner2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/239.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bust-A-Move '99 (USA)">					<description>Bust-A-Move '99 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="2a95290f" name="Bust-A-Move '99 (USA).zip" sha1="3561149DDFF17A60210EC5752781C512B6F4E126" size="8388608"/>					<plot>Think you've busted with the best?

The player can move in any direction, jump, crawl, climb, and shoot. The player must solve puzzles by disabling electronic weapons or through skillful manoeuvering.However, when battling a monster (called a &quot;biological weapon&quot; in Hybrid Heaven), the game switches to a completely different mode. The player is constrained to a small room and can no longer jump, crawl, or climb. The monster and the player move around for strategic position in the room. When they are close enough, and have built up enough energy, one or the other will decide to attack. At that point time freezes and a single round similar to a role-playing video game turn ensues: the attacker picks an attack from a list, the defender picks a defense, and the results are displayed. After the attack, both monster and player return to jockeying for position in realtime. All of this can happen within seconds, which keeps the action flowing more naturally than in most RPGs.</plot>					<genre>AdventureRole-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<releasedate>08/31/1999</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1117-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1117-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1117-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1117-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1117.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Hydro Thunder (USA)">					<description>Hydro Thunder (USA)</description>					<rom crc="6b78c2c8" name="Hydro Thunder (USA).zip" sha1="665E3D9773B0A6802814CD3E7B930CAB62FC583D" size="33554432"/>					<plot>The gameplay of Hydro Thunder consists of racing high-tech speedboats through treacherous environments, from the cold seas of the Arctic Circle, to a post-apocalyptic, flooded version of New York City.</plot>					<genre>Vehicle Simulation</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Midway Games</studio>					<releasedate>09/09/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/258-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/258-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/258.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Iggy's Reckin' Balls (USA)">					<description>Iggy's Reckin' Balls (USA)</description>					<rom crc="5953567e" name="Iggy's Reckin' Balls (USA).zip" sha1="289A26F3A0D656FF522252CAABC0E005C760FACA" size="4194304"/>					<plot>A vertical race up towering tracks.

International Cup has the player competing against a range of teams from around the world in a round robin tournament; World League is a series of 70 matches against every one of other teams in the game.The player can also contest a penalty shoot-out competition with up to 4 players, or attempt to complete certain scenario games (where each game is set up with a specific goal, for example scoring a goal within a given time limit, or stopping the opposing team from scoring, etc.).</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Konami</studio>					<releasedate>07/31/1997</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1121-1.jpg</fanart1>					<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1121-2.jpg</fanart2>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1121-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1121-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-3.jpg</snapshot3>					<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-4.jpg</snapshot4>					<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-5.jpg</snapshot5>					<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-6.jpg</snapshot6>					<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-7.jpg</snapshot7>					<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1121-8.jpg</snapshot8>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1121-g.jpg</banner1>					<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1121-g2.png</banner2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1121.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="International Track &amp; Field 2000 (USA)">					<description>International Track &amp; Field 2000 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="f93868a3" name="International Track &amp; Field 2000 (USA).zip" sha1="D5B614B9A95086B2366C5470659FA5B89FACEC68" size="12582912"/>					<plot>International Track and Field 2 from Konami is a one-to-four player game (using the Multi Tap) that features 12 different international events, ranging from weightlifting and bicycling to canoeing.

Navi guides Link to the guardian of Kokiri village, the Great Deku Tree, who is cursed and near death. Link breaks the curse, but can not stop the tree from withering. Before dying, the Great Deku Tree tells Link about a &quot;wicked man from the desert&quot; who cursed him and seeks to conquer the land of Hyrule. After Link receives the Kokiri's Emerald, the spiritual stone of the forest, he proceeds to Hyrule Castle to find Zelda, the princess of destiny.&quot; Except Master Quest's most notable feature is that every dungeon in the game has been modified to increase the difficulty of the game. Each dungeon features a different layout, changing the progression through the levels. Enemies are spread differently throughout the dungeons, and tougher enemies are encountered much earlier on than in Ocarina of Time. In addition, some Gold Skulltula locations in dungeons have been moved, and certain items that are optional in the original version are now mandatory to complete the game.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventureRole-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>02/28/2003</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/19926-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/19926-1.jpg</boxart2>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19926-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/19926-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/19926.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="LEGO Racers (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Sv,No,Da,Fi)">					<description>LEGO Racers (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Sv,No,Da,Fi)</description>					<rom crc="3339e557" name="LEGO Racers (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It,Nl,Sv,No,Da,Fi).zip" sha1="9C5B574680A18FC87C74E7C1FEEA19AAE87CC059" size="16777216"/>					<plot>In Lego Racers, the player assumes the role of either one of several pre-built Lego characters or a custom-built driver.  The camera is positioned behind the car, as in most racing games, and the player may make use of a variety of power-ups such as weapons and speed-boosters to increase their chances of winning.  The game supports keyboard and gamepad control, both of which can be fully customized in the game settings.

This game differs from the other incarnations of games from the series because of its apparent three-dimensional perspective.  While essentially running in 2-dimensional space, the player has an option to move in another direction every so often.  The levels are mostly spirals that require climbing to complete.  There are five worlds and each one must be unlocked by finding five cards from the previous world excluding the first.  Each world is divided into five stages with each stage divided into four levels.  The general goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of gold to activate a portal that allows the player to continue.  As the player progresses, each world adds new interactive objects and tools as well as new obstacles.</plot>					<genre>Platform</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Infogrames</studio>					<releasedate>07/30/1999</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1131-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1131-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1131-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1131-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1131.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Mace - The Dark Age (USA)">					<description>Mace - The Dark Age (USA)</description>					<rom crc="e49d603a" name="Mace - The Dark Age (USA).zip" sha1="55D187B8AE20D2271F96FA9A8FB76FC11301A2EB" size="12582912"/>					<plot>Mace: The Dark age is a 3D fighting game set in a dark fantasy setting.

To achieve this objective, you must avoid missiles launched by your competitors, among other things. One way to counter this is the barrel roll maneuver, which is a quick and effective way to avoid unexpected hurdles on the tracks. In the beginning, you drive a pretty unimpressive racer. However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car. You have 13 different racer body styles and nine tracks to choose from. The cartoony racers zip through city streets, ice caves, and a volcano, and with the Track Create mode, you can design the wildest track you can imagine. When you toss four-player racing into the fray, the fun quadruples as the action intensifies and the losers are utterly humiliated.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<studio>THQ</studio>					<releasedate>02/10/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1179-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1179-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1179-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Mischief Makers (USA) (Rev A)">					<description>Mischief Makers (USA) (Rev A)</description>					<rom crc="c454e245" name="Mischief Makers (USA) (Rev A).zip" sha1="3A66A71240B34DF5607C8BB84C679C44472A6DA2" size="8388608"/>					<plot>Marina's main way of attacking is her grab move.

The cars range from 4X4s, trucks, and off-road racers to slick street cars, Lamborghinis and the like. While initially it may seem like there is a deficit of courses, in fact, the multi-terrain courses contain mini-courses within each one. For instance, at least three times in each course, you will have the choice to take two different road directions -- either rough dirt track or snow-laden road, ot a slick but usually longer street course. Each car handles terrains differently, and some, like the trucks, obviously handle the off-roads better than others, but you can also modify your street car to handle dirst roads well, too.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Imagineer</studio>					<releasedate>08/31/1997</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1150-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1150-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1150-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Ms. Pac-Man - Maze Madness (USA)">					<description>Ms. Pac-Man - Maze Madness (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d5017d76" name="Ms. Pac-Man - Maze Madness (USA).zip" sha1="B3924A297A03A0B10FF246A7C90F424C90E7AB64" size="12582912"/>					<plot>Professor Pac learns that the witch, Mesmerelda, has seized control of the Enchanted Castle using black magic and from there is planning on stealing all four Gems of Virtue (Generosity; Truth; Wisdom; Courage) to control the &quot;four wonders&quot; (areas of Pac-Land).

The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshipping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living. All of London is in a panic and vulnerable to the schemes of Adam Crowley, a mad scientist and occultist enlisting the help of the Brotherhood.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Activision</studio>					<releasedate>11/01/1998</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1173-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1173-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1173-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1173.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Nuclear Strike 64 (USA)">					<description>Nuclear Strike 64 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="1a70d11a" name="Nuclear Strike 64 (USA).zip" sha1="EA1371D29CBDEDE166A69C77B2C4A77D6EDAB77D" size="33554432"/>					<plot>Nuclear Strike 64 is a helicopter-based game, with strategy elements added to the action gameplay.

To achieve this objective, you must avoid missiles launched by your competitors, among other things. One way to counter this is the barrel roll maneuver, which is a quick and effective way to avoid unexpected hurdles on the tracks. In the beginning, you drive a pretty unimpressive racer. However, if you beat the competition and place in the top three, your reward is the chance to upgrade your car. Be merciless and steal the losing racers' special features, such as engine and armor upgrades, special attack abilities, and enhancing cosmetic features for the car. You have 13 different racer body styles and nine tracks to choose from.

It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 and was the first RPG released for the system in the United States.The game differs from most other RPGs in that the experience system is not based upon a traditional &quot;level-up&quot; model. Instead, experience is gained for specific stats based on how the player performs in battle. If the character gets hit a lot, for instance, defense will increase. Also, whenever the player finds a wispy white spirit, they can choose an element of magic to upgrade (from Fire, Water, Earth, and Wind). Leveling up these elements grants the character new attacks and strengthens existing ones.The game has no money system which is unusual for an RPG. Every item is either found in a treasure chest, given to the player character free of charge, or dropped by a monster, if the character doesn't have one already. If Brian runs out of HP, the game will return him to the last inn at which he saved. He retains all spells, items, and experience he has gained before death, but any items used before death will not be returned.</plot>					<genre>Role-Playing</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>THQ</studio>					<releasedate>06/11/1998</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1185-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1185-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1185-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1185-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1185.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Rally Challenge 2000 (USA)">					<description>Rally Challenge 2000 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="faf5c3b6" name="Rally Challenge 2000 (USA).zip" sha1="ECD309FC0826467F7B0E197743ABF1C51C48910D" size="12582912"/>					<plot>Speed is the name of the game in this realistic racing experience.

The game's four distinct play modes offer limitless challenges: there's a user-friendly Arcade mode, an intense four-player Versus mode, a convenient Practice mode, and a Championship mode which allows you to adjust your suspension, tires, gear ratios, and steering. Championship Mode the game's crown jewel presents you with a nine-race series, in which you must rack up more points than your competitors.

The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds.

The success of the Dreamcast version led to it becoming one of the few Sega All Stars titles.Like Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series it features many characters with colorful personalities (i.e. Afro Thunder, Boris &quot;The Bear&quot; Knokimov, etc.); however, unlike the Punch-Out!! series, Ready 2 Rumble Boxing is in 3D, thus allowing for more control over your character in the ring, and also enables the players to choose whichever fighters they want.Throughout the fights in the game, there is a special RUMBLE meter which fills up, one letter at a time, until the word &quot;RUMBLE&quot; is spelled at the bottom of the screen. Letters can be obtained by successfully landing hard blows or taunting the opponent. Once the meter is full, the player can power himself up, enabling access to a special move called &quot;Rumble Flurry&quot;, which might as well instantly knock the opposite player out cold.One unique graphic feature of the game is the gradual bruises gained by players as the fight progresses (like hematomas and swellings), present in all fifth-generation versions. While this is not necessarily a new feature to games (it had been implemented before in SNK's 1992 game Art of Fighting), it garnered much appraisal from reviewers, because of the added fun factor this element supply to the game</plot>					<genre>FightingSports</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Midway</studio>					<releasedate>10/31/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/396-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/396-1.jpg</boxart1>			</game>			<game name="Ready 2 Rumble Boxing - Round 2 (USA)">					<description>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing - Round 2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="a64fdf28" name="Ready 2 Rumble Boxing - Round 2 (USA).zip" sha1="3E6B280A6B8925C0528C63ADD72F0861156D07D6" size="33554432"/>					<plot>Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits the player land consecutively, letters that spell out &quot;RUMBLE&quot; appear below the player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of &quot;RUMBLE&quot;, which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.</plot>					<genre>FightingSports</genre>					<studio>Midway</studio>					<releasedate>10/23/2000</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1190-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1190-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1190-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1190.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Resident Evil 2 (USA)">					<description>Resident Evil 2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d890979f" name="Resident Evil 2 (USA).zip" sha1="D173856A276CEF9D43D14C1BCC9F9C383D49A938" size="67108864"/>					<plot>Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror video game by Capcom originally released for the PlayStation in 1998. The second installment in the Resident Evil series, its story takes place two months after the events of the first game and is set in Raccoon City, a Midwestern mountain community whose residents have been turned into zombies by the T-virus, a biological weapon developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. In their escape from the city, the two protagonists Leon S.

The main improvement over the predecessor is the &quot;Zapping System&quot; that provides each playable character with a different scenario featuring unique storylines and puzzles. Developed with a team of about 40 to 50 people over the course of one year and nine months, Resident Evil 2 was directed by Hideki Kamiya and produced by Shinji Mikami.

To that end, Rocket employs an advanced physics engine which allows the main character, a lovable unicycle-based robot named Rocket, to travel and experiment with colorful, platform-esque worlds with realistic gravity and inertia.

In &quot;The Pirate Treasure Hunt,&quot; the babies travel underwater in search of items; &quot;Angelica's Temple of Gloom&quot; challenges players to find bits of Stu's broken Aztec statues before Angelica can; and &quot;Reptar Rally&quot; has the babies collecting sweets in Candy Island. Once you choose your baby from a list that includes Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, or Lil, you begin using a spinner (just like a board game spinner) to determine how many spaces you'll advance. There are lots of trick spaces that give you advantages or disadvantages, like the Spike the Dog spot (which allows you to ride the pet for five spaces), and a Dil spot (which makes Dil come out and shuffle the board).

As with previous titles in the franchise, Rush 2049 features a stunt mode in which the player scores points for complex mid-air maneuvers and successful landings. There is also a multiplayer deathmatch battle mode. There are six race tracks, four stunt arenas, eight battle arenas, and one unlockable obstacle course named The Gauntlet. The single player race mode places emphasis on outlandish and death-defying shortcuts in each track.

The debate escalates to the point where they decide to hold a snowboarding tournament to determine who is the best. One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.In addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds &quot;Shots&quot; (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.The game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.There were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<releasedate>05/03/1998</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1202-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1202-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1202-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1202-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Snowboard Kids 2 (USA)">					<description>Snowboard Kids 2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="ca84aace" name="Snowboard Kids 2 (USA).zip" sha1="7A195B4D0D03CE1C7C4FD0D13B1BE2E97D20000C" size="16777216"/>					<plot>The game is set in Snow Town, which is the main hometown of the protagonists. The plot follows the daily lives and adventures of the kids, and the rather ridiculous attempts of Damien to sabotage them.The gameplay of this game is almost identical to its predecessor's, but with a few differences.There are now three distinct playing modes: the Story mode, which follows the game plot and uses the classical system of cash prizes by winning the races; the battle mode, which includes multiplayer mode; and the Training mode.There were new additions and changes to the Items and Shots. All of them were redesigned and the Shots were renamed as Weapons. Additions include the Rocket, the Wings and the Whirlwind (see more below). Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick.The special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air. It also added the ability to repel Weapon attacks by performing a Trick or Board Grab in the imminence of the hit. The player can also look behind by pressing the R button.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Atlus</studio>					<releasedate>03/02/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1203-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1203-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/1203-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1203-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="South Park (USA)">					<description>South Park (USA)</description>					<rom crc="faae9aa3" name="South Park (USA).zip" sha1="5133B87061172B467424170672C3321DE6C78494" size="16777216"/>					<plot>Single player takes the form of a &quot;Story&quot; mode divided into five episodes and fifteen linear levels. The player will face weak minions (which change based on the episode), plus occasional sub-bosses which will try to escape into town. The final level is devoted to a unique boss fight. Players use quirky weapons ranging from infinite yellow snowballs to cow launchers and toxic Terrance and Phillip dolls. Every weapon has a secondary fire, and players switch between the four main characters when they switch weapons - each of the four kids shares a single life bar because of this. The kids will comment on game actions as they occur, with heavier profanity censored with bleeps. The kids will get angrier (and fouler) as their health depletes, until they finally give up on saving the town and go home.</plot>					<genre>Shooter</genre>					<studio>Acclaim</studio>					<releasedate>12/12/1998</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1204-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1204-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1204-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1204-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1204.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="South Park - Chef's Luv Shack (USA)">					<description>South Park - Chef's Luv Shack (USA)</description>					<rom crc="67d38382" name="South Park - Chef's Luv Shack (USA).zip" sha1="54FB22142F3A02C9C15E412D7E900A963698BBDA" size="16777216"/>					<plot>South Park: Chef's Luv Shack is a 2D game-show style video game based on the television show South Park.

SUPER BOWLING 64 features more characters than you can shake a stick at. In addition to the group of Japanese teens central to the game, you can play as a pixie, a blue giant, or a robotic penguin. Just to add to the offbeat nature of the game, bowling locations include a Japanese house, a brick-walled mansion, and a garage without gutters.

In Super Smash Bros., characters have a damage total, represented by a percentage value, which rises as they take damage and can exceed 100%, but maxes out at 999%. As a character's percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, usually a set of suspended platforms.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Nintendo</studio>					<releasedate>01/21/1999</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/404-3.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/404-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/404-1.jpg</boxart1>					<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/404-1.jpg</snapshot1>					<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/404-2.jpg</snapshot2>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/404-g.png</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/404.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Supercross 2000 (USA)">					<description>Supercross 2000 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="5a8a721d" name="Supercross 2000 (USA).zip" sha1="03CBBFB4F57E2813CBE9050401D6144724B84D6F" size="16777216"/>					<plot>EA SPORTS introduces the exclusive game of the Supercross Series.

To add to the realism, all in-game characters, terrorists, hostages and Rainbow operatives, can be wounded or dispatched in just fractions of a second. Tools such as thicker body armor, automatic rifles, and grenades have little value before the player grows accustomed to the gameplay.Before each mission is a planning stage, during which the player is given a briefing, and then chooses the operatives to be involved in the mission, their weapons, equipment and uniform/camouflage. In earlier games, the player pre-established orders and waypoints during this step. The planning stage determined elements such as the path the AI-controlled squads would follow during the mission, as well as where they will deploy devices such as flashbangs or door breaching charges.</plot>					<genre>ActionShooterStrategy</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Red Storm Entertainment</studio>					<releasedate>05/15/1998</releasedate>					<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1216-1.jpg</fanart1>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1216-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1216-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1216-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1216.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Tommy Thunder (USA) (Proto)">					<description>Tommy Thunder (USA) (Proto)</description>					<rom crc="e5bc76d8" name="Tommy Thunder (USA) (Proto).zip" sha1="9FFB0084E560395E788DCC18D6FA3D238F0E9853" size="8388608"/>					<plot>The gameplay of Hydro Thunder consists of racing high-tech speedboats through treacherous environments, from the cold seas of the Arctic Circle, to a post-apocalyptic, flooded version of New York City.</plot>					<genre>Vehicle Simulation</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Midway Games</studio>					<releasedate>09/09/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/258-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/258-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/258.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Tonic Trouble (USA) (Rev A)">					<description>Tonic Trouble (USA) (Rev A)</description>					<rom crc="0ecd289a" name="Tonic Trouble (USA) (Rev A).zip" sha1="88F9ACE09F949A43253D37896E75472BC9AE6D12" size="16777216"/>					<plot>Tonic Trouble is a 3D platforming video game by Ubisoft Montreal. The story follows the main character, Ed, after a magic potion spills on the Earth and causes vegetables to become living killers. The game was received poorly; critics cite poor controls, a wordy exposition, and sloppy graphics (on the N64 version). The N64 version of the game is a port of the PC version with noticeable differences, such as a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes, and different music in certain places. The game is often compared to another game published by Ubisoft called Rayman 2: The Great Escape, because both are 3D platformers, both have main characters of a similar design (hands and feet without arms or legs), and both were released around the same time.</plot>					<genre>ActionAdventure</genre>					<nplayers>1</nplayers>					<studio>Ubisoft</studio>					<releasedate>08/31/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1217-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1217-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1217-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1217.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (USA)">					<description>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (USA)</description>					<rom crc="ee2c9008" name="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (USA).zip" sha1="7523D5E43EE18FC1298E8CE6656EFFCDB7B0C1B7" size="12582912"/>					<plot>Go Big, Go Pro!

The Championship mode has you alternating between dirt and street racing as you compete for points. You earn new bikes and courses along the way like many other games, but interesting twist is going from one kind of racing to the other. The physics of each type of racing are very different, and you'll have to switch back and forth between dirt and racing tactics on the fly. The dirt bike racing is a lot more arcadey with all of the jumps and wide open tracks. You can earn turbo by pulling off tricks and there's really nothing to stop you from testing your stunt skills while racing except your own nerve and imagination. In this way, Hyperbike is like Hydro Thunder where you're expected to lean on that turbo button the whole time and it's up to your racing skills to ensure there's turbo available.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Kemco</studio>					<releasedate>03/21/2000</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1220-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1220-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1220-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1220.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Top Gear Overdrive (USA)">					<description>Top Gear Overdrive (USA)</description>					<rom crc="b5b23053" name="Top Gear Overdrive (USA).zip" sha1="2B79D74949BC631E74379720265E8633806290AF" size="12582912"/>					<plot>In the main mode of play, the player races through six seasons, each season containing more races from more tracks, and with faster cars competing.At the beginning of the race the player would start at the back of the grid, at the start line. Computer players at the front of the grid would often start a third of the way around the first lap. Players started with three charges of nitrous oxide, which were used to give the player a temporary speed boost.Shortcuts were available on each track, and often the use of these decided the outcome of the races, particularly in later seasons.At the end of each race the player would be presented with a screen to allow for various upgrades to their car, such as to acceleration and handling. The player was also able to change their car for a better (or worse) vehicle and could buy extra nitrous oxide to use in the next race.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Kemco</studio>					<releasedate>11/23/1998</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1221-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1221-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1221-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1221.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Top Gear Rally (USA)">					<description>Top Gear Rally (USA)</description>					<rom crc="a04f1cc0" name="Top Gear Rally (USA).zip" sha1="0DDE80BAE97B82FA56496360FC6B1BBFEACA6999" size="8388608"/>					<plot>On the Nintendo 64, Top Gear Rally features a realistic physics model with functioning suspension. At the time, this was an impressive new gameplay development. Road surfaces, including their imperfections, were accurately modeled to give the player the feeling of actually driving a car.The performance of each vehicle in the game was unique. Not only with respect to engine power, but also areas such as tire grip, suspension stiffness, steering tightness, and between different drive-trains such as front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, and four-wheel drive. The game also features the possibility of damaging the vehicles, although the damage does not affect performance. The game features a soundtrack consisting of tunes with a sort of trance-style. The electronic XM music was composed by Barry Leitch, who also worked on Super Nintendo Top Gear releases.</plot>					<genre>Vehicle Simulation</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Midway Games</studio>					<releasedate>01/01/1997</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/963-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/963-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/963.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Top Gear Rally 2 (USA)">					<description>Top Gear Rally 2 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="7e4e181c" name="Top Gear Rally 2 (USA).zip" sha1="2C51EF2CA9B738DAA5F70B8199A64CD765A44243" size="12582912"/>					<plot>Top Gear Rally 2 is a racing game for the Nintendo 64.

Strikes, riots and crime were rampant, and all available law enforcement were brought to the cities leaving the outlands vulnerable. A foreign multinational oil consortium, Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime (OMAR), was determined to monopolize the world oil trade. The U.S. was the last country that stood in their way and they were prepared to go to any length to bring the U.S. to its knees.OMAR hired Sid Burn, a professional terrorist, to push the U.S. economy over the edge. Sid began to organize his troops in the remote areas of the southwest. Calling themselves the &quot;Coyotes,&quot; they began to target oil refineries, commercial installations and other vital industry throughout the region. With the law enforcement in the cities, some desperate civilians began to take the law into their own hands. Led by a trucker named Convoy and referred to simply as the &quot;Vigilantes,&quot; this oddball group soon became a major hindrance to Sid.Meanwhile, the U.S. government, feeling more vulnerable than ever, was intensifying its research and development of a new military arsenal. The most advanced weaponry, rumored to be based on UFO technology, was located at Site-4, a secret facility at Papoose Lake. This information was not lost on Sid, and the Coyotes ambushed the facility. However the Vigilantes unexpectedly appeared to stop them and as a result, both parties found themselves in possession of the world's most advanced weaponry.What followed were no ordinary skirmishes. Auto clashes ensued all over the land, from Colorado's Rockies to California's farmlands, only to culminate in a battle like no other. To this day the events which took place are only a matter of speculation.</plot>					<genre>ActionVehicle SimulationShooter</genre>					<nplayers>4+</nplayers>					<studio>Activision</studio>					<releasedate>05/31/1998</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/964-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/964-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/964.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Vigilante 8 - 2nd Offense (USA)">					<description>Vigilante 8 - 2nd Offense (USA)</description>					<rom crc="764abdb3" name="Vigilante 8 - 2nd Offense (USA).zip" sha1="2DA6A5A3FA61077949582154597A4717BCF51E3A" size="12582912"/>					<plot>The story of Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense centers on the international meddlings of an oil conglomerate from the future known as OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime).After finding an electronic armband in a service station bathroom, former Vigilante Slick Clyde rose to be controlled by OMAR.

It was the final World Championship Wrestling (WCW) game released before the company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).WCW Backstage Assault takes over 50 WCW wrestlers out of the ring and into real-world venues like a locker room, garage and a loading dock. Traditional wrestling moves can be used, but weapons like two-by-fours and trash cans are also thrown into the mix. By working your way through the game's various modes, you can unlock additional wrestlers, areas and weapons. Bobby Heenan and Tony Schiavone provide the commentary with over 8,000 lines of dialogue.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<studio>Electronic Arts</studio>					<releasedate>12/12/2000</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/412-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/412-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/412.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="WCW Mayhem (USA)">					<description>WCW Mayhem (USA)</description>					<rom crc="a1911368" name="WCW Mayhem (USA).zip" sha1="0B848A7747C97286D42764F9237D9EF05B39BECD" size="16777216"/>					<plot>WCW Mayhem is based on Ted Turner's hit cable wrestling league World Championship Wrestling. The game takes many of it's wrestlers and combines them with authentic moves, settings, and actual events found on the various cable programs and pay-per-view specials.&quot;Mayhem&quot; is probably an accurate word to describe the first wrestling game from Electronic Arts. A TV-style presentation features play-by-play commentary along with signature entrances enhanced by pyrotechnics and theme music. Over 50 professional wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling are included, although you'll need to play through the &quot;Quest for the Best&quot; mode to unlock them all.</plot>					<genre>Sports</genre>					<studio>Electronic Arts</studio>					<releasedate>08/31/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1233-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1233-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/1233-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/1233.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="WCW Nitro (USA) (Alt 1)">					<description>WCW Nitro (USA) (Alt 1)</description>					<rom crc="428336e2" name="WCW Nitro (USA) (Alt 1).zip" sha1="73634AFA7CA80A955F0CA38D34EE0816E540EE4E" size="12582912"/>					<plot>Go for the gold, as you take on the Superstars of WCW and the NWO in Singles, Tag Team or Battle Royale competition!

The development team was able to optimize the usage of the various processors within the N64 to allow far draw distance (reducing the need for fog or pop-up), high detail texturing and models, Doppler effect audio, and advanced lighting and fog effects for realistic weather conditions. Impressively the game has a high resolution 640x480 mode that does not require the add-on N64 RAM Expansion Pak. Additionally, unlike many other games of its type on the platform, the game runs high resolution at a sufficiently playable pace, undoubtedly due to the use of a reduced screen area letterbox mode that lessens the number of pixels needing to be displayed.</plot>					<genre>Racing</genre>					<nplayers>2</nplayers>					<studio>Midway</studio>					<releasedate>06/16/1999</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/414-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/414-1.jpg</boxart1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/414.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Worms Armageddon (USA) (En,Fr,Es)">					<description>Worms Armageddon (USA) (En,Fr,Es)</description>					<rom crc="556268b7" name="Worms Armageddon (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip" sha1="04D60D848A5CB9923EB95B016EEBB6AF829296F2" size="12582912"/>					<plot>Gameplay is turn-based, with each team moving in sequence (which is determined randomly) across two-dimensional terrain.

These include training mode, one-on-one, tag team, cage match, weapons match, tornado tag team, and war (elimination free for all). Two additional modes, Royal Rumble and gauntlet, are exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version. The player can also create and customize his own wrestler, taking him through the WWF challenge. The new wrestler finds himself at the bottom of a pyramid, and has to challenge wrestlers situated immediately above him, gradually working his way through to the title. Sometimes previously defeated wrestlers will challenge the player to a &quot;grudge match&quot;, which usually consists of special encounters, such as battles with weapons or cage matches.</plot>					<genre>Fighting</genre>					<studio>Acclaim</studio>					<releasedate>08/11/1998</releasedate>					<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2759-1.jpg</boxart2>					<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2759-1.jpg</boxart1>					<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2759-g.jpg</banner1>					<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2759.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="WWF WrestleMania 2000 (USA)">					<description>WWF WrestleMania 2000 (USA)</description>					<rom crc="d514e83c" name="WWF WrestleMania 2000 (USA).zip" sha1="D8CF547EB81C72C748BE87B6CE6B2F66C2699BD0" size="33554432"/>					<videoid>hcSx-ABjaMU</videoid>					<plot>The greatest wrestling game ever created!
