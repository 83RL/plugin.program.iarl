Internet Archive ROM Launcher
==========================
![enter image description here](https://github.com/zach-morris/plugin.program.iarl/blob/master/fanart.jpg)

The Internet Archive ROM Launcher (IARL) will launch Games using [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) and [Retroplayer](https://github.com/garbear/xbmc).

----------

How does it work
-------------

IARL uses xml files to provide the information for Games on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).  The database can also provide media for each Game (Fanart / Boxart / Snapshots / Trailer / etc).   You can use the xml files I've created or create your own.  If you create more please let me know and I can include them.

----------

To do
-------------------

 - Revise the xml database files for accuracy.  Some of the media is not accurate for the ROM listed.  Any help with this would be appreciated :-)
   
 - Add additional sources.  This depends on which cores for retroplayer are available / working.
   
 - Add functionality for downloading ROMs to a different location (currently downloads only go to the userdata folder)
   
 - Bug fixes / code robustness
