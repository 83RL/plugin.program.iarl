Are you interested in having a large game collection, but not interested in storing all that data on your computer?

_Then IARL is for you!_

The Internet Archive ROM Launcher (IARL) will launch Games using [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) and [Retroplayer](https://github.com/garbear/xbmc).

----------


How does it work
-------------

IARL uses xml files to provide the information for Games on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org).  The database can also provide media for each Game (Fanart / Boxart / Snapshots / Trailer / etc).   You can use the xml files I've created or create your own.  If you create more please let me know and I can include them.
